            <p class="lead">Backlinks are like votes of confidence from other websites. The more quality links pointing to your site, the more authority Google gives you. But not all links are created equal—and for local businesses, local links matter most. Here are 20 proven strategies to earn high-quality backlinks from your community.</p>

            <h2>Why Local Backlinks Matter</h2>

            <p>Before we dive into the 20 strategies, let&rsquo;s talk about why you should care about local links. <a href="/blog/backlinks-local-seo-nh.html">Backlinks are a major ranking factor</a> for Google. They signal trust, authority, and relevance. A link from a local Chamber of Commerce carries more weight for a local business than a link from a random website in another state.</p>

            <p>Local backlinks tell Google: &ldquo;This is a legitimate, trusted business in this community.&rdquo; They also send referral traffic from real local users, meaning you don&rsquo;t just get SEO benefits—you get actual customers.</p>

            <p>Plus, <a href="/blog/nh-seo-checklist-2026.html">building local links keeps you ahead of competitors</a> who ignore link building entirely. Most small businesses don&rsquo;t do this, so it&rsquo;s a real opportunity to gain ground.</p>

            <h2>1. Chamber of Commerce and Business Association Links</h2>

            <p>Join your local Chamber of Commerce, Convention and Visitors Bureau, and industry associations. These organizations almost always link to their member directories from their homepage—a link from a Chamber site is valuable.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Look up your Chamber of Commerce (e.g., &ldquo;[City] Chamber of Commerce&rdquo;). Join as a business member. Request that your business website be linked from their member directory. Ask for the link URL so you can confirm it&rsquo;s active.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> A high-authority link from a trusted local source. Plus, membership credibility on your website and in marketing materials.</p>

            <h2>2. Local Sponsorships (Sports Teams, Charities, School Programs)</h2>

            <p>Sponsor a local youth baseball team, charity 5K run, school fundraiser, or community event. Most event websites have a &ldquo;sponsors&rdquo; page that lists all sponsors with links to their websites.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Look for local events in your area. Call the organizer and ask about sponsorship opportunities. The sponsorship cost can range from $250 to $2,500 depending on the event. Once you sponsor, verify that your business name and link appear on their event page. If not, follow up and ask for it.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> A relevant, local link. Community goodwill. Often local media coverage of the event (which can lead to more links). Tax-deductible business expense.</p>

            <h2>3. Guest Posting on Local Blogs and News Sites</h2>

            <p>Write guest articles for local news outlets, community blogs, and local business publications. These sites get traffic and authority passes through to their contributors.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Find local blogs, news sites, and business publications covering your area. Go to their &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; or &ldquo;submit an article&rdquo; page. Pitch ideas that are helpful to their audience—not salesy. Examples: &ldquo;5 Signs Your Plumbing Needs Attention,&rdquo; &ldquo;How to Choose a Trustworthy Contractor,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Winter Home Maintenance for local Homeowners.&rdquo;</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> A byline link back to your site. Traffic from local readers. Authority boost from a local, trusted source. <a href="/blog/content-marketing-local-seo.html">Content marketing opportunity</a> to showcase expertise.</p>

            <h2>4. HARO (Help a Reporter Out) and Journalist Queries</h2>

            <p>HARO (now Connectively/Source of Sources) is a service where journalists pitch questions to experts. When you answer their query, your name and website appear in the published article.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Sign up at Connectively.com (the new HARO platform). Look for daily queries in your industry. When you see a relevant question from a journalist, send a well-crafted, quotable answer within the deadline (usually 24 hours). If your quote is published, you get a link and media coverage.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Links from major publications (Forbes, Huffington Post, etc.). Credibility and authority boost. Media coverage and PR value.</p>

            <h2>5. Local Event Hosting and Event Page Links</h2>

            <p>Host a free webinar, workshop, or in-person event in your community. List it on Eventbrite and local event sites. Each listing is a link back to your website.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Choose a topic your customers care about. Create a simple event page on your website with registration. Add it to Eventbrite, Meetup.com, Facebook Events, and local event calendars. Promote it via email and social media. Event sites will link back to your registration page.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Multiple local links. Direct relationship building with customers. Email list growth. Content for videos or social media. Authority as a local expert.</p>

            <h2>6. Partnership Cross-Linking with Complementary Businesses</h2>

            <p>Partner with nearby, non-competing businesses to cross-link on each other&rsquo;s sites. A plumber can partner with an electrician. A therapist can partner with a chiropractor. A bakery can partner with a coffee shop.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Identify 5-10 local businesses that serve the same customers but don&rsquo;t compete directly. Reach out with a proposal: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to feature your business on my website and link to you. In return, would you feature us on yours?&rdquo; Create a &ldquo;local partners&rdquo; or &ldquo;trusted vendors&rdquo; page on your site listing these businesses with links.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Relevant local links. Referral traffic from partner sites. Community relationships. Co-marketing opportunities.</p>

            <h2>7. Local Resource Page Link Building</h2>

            <p>Many local websites have resource pages listing helpful local businesses and organizations. Getting on these pages means a quality link from a relevant site.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Search for &ldquo;[your industry] resources [your city]&rdquo; and &ldquo;[your city] business directory&rdquo; to find local resource pages. Contact the webmaster or site owner and pitch: &ldquo;I noticed your resource page for [topic]. We&rsquo;d be a great addition as a local [your business type]. Would you consider adding a link to us?&rdquo; Make it easy by providing the exact text and link they should use.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Relevant local links. Often multiple links if your business fits multiple categories. Referral traffic from resource seekers.</p>

            <h2>8. Scholarship Link Building (Create a Local Scholarship)</h2>

            <p>Create a scholarship for local high school or college students. List it on scholarship search websites and local educational sites. Each site linking to your scholarship is a backlink.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Decide on a scholarship amount (even $500/year helps). Create a scholarship page on your website with application details. Submit to major scholarship databases: FastWeb, ScholarshipPoints, GoCollege, and local education foundations. The ROI goes beyond links—it&rsquo;s genuine community impact and brand building.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Multiple links from education and scholarship sites. Strong community goodwill and PR. Brand recognition among students and families. Tax-deductible charitable contribution.</p>

            <h2>9. Podcast Appearances and Interview Links</h2>

            <p>Appear as a guest expert on local or industry podcasts. Most podcasts list guest bios with links to their websites or social profiles in the show notes.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Find podcasts covering your industry or serving your local area. Reach out to the podcast host with a pitch: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to discuss [topic] with your audience.&rdquo; Make it specific and valuable. Once you record, request that a link to your website be included in the show notes.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Links from podcast show pages. Referral traffic from listeners. Authority as an expert. Often, the podcast is shared on social media, amplifying your reach.</p>

            <h2>10. Local Directory Submissions (Beyond Basic Citations)</h2>

            <p>Beyond Google Business Profile, submit your business to specialized local directories. Unlike generic citations, some directories include actual links.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Submit to industry-specific directories (e.g., contractors on HomeAdvisor, lawyers on Avvo, accountants on NAPTP). Submit to local chamber directories, tourism boards, and specialty directories relevant to your business. <a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">Make sure NAP information is consistent</a> everywhere.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> High-authority links from established directories. Better local visibility. Often leads to qualified referral traffic. Improves <a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">NAP consistency</a> signals.</p>

            <h2>11. Creating Linkable Local Content (Guides, Stats, Research)</h2>

            <p>Create original content that's so useful, local sites link to it naturally. Think neighborhood guides, local market research, cost-of-living breakdowns, or industry data specific to your area.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Identify a gap in local information. Create an authoritative, data-backed resource. Examples: &ldquo;The Complete Guide to Moving to [City],&rdquo; &ldquo;Home Prices and Market Trends in [Neighborhood],&rdquo; &ldquo;Cost of Living in [City] vs. [Neighboring City],&rdquo; or &ldquo;Best Neighborhoods for Families in [Area].&rdquo; Publish it on your blog, then pitch it to local media and bloggers.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Natural links from local media, bloggers, and educators citing your research. Significant SEO value. Positioning as a local authority. Reusable asset for PR and marketing.</p>

            <h2>12. Broken Link Building on Local Sites</h2>

            <p>Find broken links on local websites and pitch them a replacement—your content. This is a win for the webmaster (they fix a broken link) and you (you get a link).</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Use tools like Check My Links (Chrome extension) or Ahrefs Site Explorer to find broken links on local business websites, news sites, and community directories. Contact the webmaster: &ldquo;I noticed a broken link on your [page name]. I have relevant content that might work as a replacement.&rdquo; Include your link and a brief description.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Relevant links from local sites. High acceptance rate (you&rsquo;re solving their problem). Niche, targeted links rather than generic ones.</p>

            <h2>13. Testimonial Link Building (Leave Reviews for Local Vendors)</h2>

            <p>When you use a service—accounting firm, web host, software—ask them for a testimonial page. Testimonial pages often link to the business being reviewed.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Use local vendors for your business needs: accountants, web designers, printers, IT support, etc. Leave genuine, detailed reviews on their websites or review sites. Ask if they have a testimonials page on their website where they link to businesses they&rsquo;ve worked with. Request to be featured.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Links from local service providers. Credibility boost (you&rsquo;re vouching for your vendors). Reciprocal relationships that can lead to referrals.</p>

            <h2>14. Local News Coverage and Press Releases</h2>

            <p>Generate local news coverage, and journalists will link to your website. Press releases, business announcements, and community involvement make good news hooks.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Identify newsworthy angles: new location or service launch, hiring, awards, community sponsorships, or unique local insights. Write a concise press release. Send it to local reporters, news outlets, and press release distribution services. Follow up with a personal email if you have a relationship. Local news sites almost always link to the businesses they cover.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Links from high-authority news sites. Credibility boost from media coverage. Potential traffic from news readers. Social media amplification when news is shared.</p>

            <h2>15. Social Proof from Local Influencers</h2>

            <p>Build relationships with local influencers and micro-influencers. When they feature your business or write about you, they link to you in their content.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Identify influencers in your local area (bloggers, social media personalities, community leaders). Engage with their content genuinely. Send them a personalized message or offer a free product/service they might enjoy featuring. The goal is authentic relationships, not transactional deals. If they feature you, ask them to include a link to your website.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Links from trusted local voices. Audience access to people interested in your niche. Social media amplification. Often leads to word-of-mouth referrals.</p>

            <h2>16. University and Educational Institution Links</h2>

            <p>Universities and educational institutions often create resource lists for their students and community. Businesses supporting education get featured with links.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Contact your local university or community college career centers, business schools, or community outreach offices. Offer to sponsor an internship program, speak to students, or support a relevant cause. Offer equipment or services at a discount. In exchange, ask to be listed on their resources page.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Links from high-authority .edu domains. Strong credibility boost (educational sites are trusted). Talent pipeline from internship programs. Brand reputation as an education supporter.</p>

            <h2>17. Local Government and .Gov Links</h2>

            <p>Government websites (.gov) carry immense authority. Getting featured on local government sites is one of the most valuable links you can earn.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Check your city or county website for business directories, economic development pages, or community resources. Contact your economic development office or chamber liaison to get listed. Offer to sponsor a local government initiative or community program. Many government sites link to approved contractors or businesses.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Links from the highest-authority domain type (.gov). Strong local relevance signal. Improved <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">local authority and trust signals</a>. Access to public procurement opportunities.</p>

            <h2>18. Niche Directory Links (Industry-Specific)</h2>

            <p>Industry-specific directories are goldmines for niche, relevant links. A real estate agent should be on real estate directories; a therapist on psychology/counseling directories.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Research industry directories specific to your field. Examples: for contractors, look at HomeAdvisor, Angie&rsquo;s List, The Knot; for financial advisors, look at NAPFA; for lawyers, look at Avvo and State Bar listings. Submit comprehensive profiles with links to your website. These directories attract highly qualified traffic.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Highly relevant, niche links. Qualified referral traffic (someone actively seeking your service). Better local and industry visibility. <a href="/blog/local-seo-for-electricians.html">Industry-specific credibility</a>.</p>

            <h2>19. Community Involvement Content That Earns Natural Links</h2>

            <p>Be active in your community in visible ways: sponsor local nonprofits, join boards, volunteer publicly. When local outlets cover community involvement, they link to businesses involved.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Join nonprofit boards, volunteer visibly, sponsor local causes, and attend community events. Ensure your participation gets shared on social media and community calendars. Pitch local news about your involvement. Share photos and stories. When local outlets cover community news, they often link to featured businesses.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Natural links from earned media coverage. Genuine community relationships. Employee engagement and morale. Brand reputation as a civic-minded business. <a href="/blog/track-seo-results.html">Measurable community impact</a> that differentiates you from competitors.</p>

            <h2>20. Podcast Guest Appearances and Interview Placements</h2>

            <p>Beyond being a podcast guest, offer to be interviewed for local radio, YouTube channels, or video series. Video platforms often feature a description with your website link.</p>

            <p><strong>How to execute:</strong> Reach out to local radio stations, YouTube creators, and video podcasters. Pitch an interesting angle relevant to their audience. Example: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to discuss [topic] on your show. My audience is [description], and I think your viewers would find value in this perspective.&rdquo; Once you appear, ensure your website link is in the description or show notes.</p>

            <p><strong>What you get:</strong> Links from video and media platforms. Direct referral traffic from viewers. Authority as a media-featured expert. Content you can repurpose (clips, quotes, testimonials).</p>

            <h2>Link Building Strategy: The Priority Order</h2>

            <p>Not all links are equally easy to earn. Here&rsquo;s the priority order to maximize results:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Quick wins (Week 1-2):</strong> <a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">Chamber of Commerce</a>, local directories, niche directories, .gov links</li>
                <li><strong>Medium effort (Month 1):</strong> Guest posting, partnerships with complementary businesses, testimonials</li>
                <li><strong>Medium-high effort (Month 2-3):</strong> Press releases, local news outreach, events, sponsorships</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term (ongoing):</strong> Create linkable content, HARO responses, podcast appearances, community involvement</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Most businesses see measurable ranking improvements after earning 10-15 quality local links over 2-3 months. <a href="/blog/backlinks-local-seo-nh.html">Backlink quality matters far more than quantity</a>. One link from your city government is worth 10 links from random directories.</p>

            <h2>Measuring Link Building Success</h2>

            <p>Track your links in Google Search Console and backlink tools like Ahrefs or Semrush. Monitor:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Number of new backlinks per month</li>
                <li>Domain authority of linking sites</li>
                <li>Local relevance (are links from your area/industry?)</li>
                <li>Referral traffic from backlinks</li>
                <li>Ranking improvements for target keywords</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You should see ranking movement on local keywords within 3-6 months of consistent <a href="/blog/content-marketing-local-seo.html">link building and content creation</a>.</p>
