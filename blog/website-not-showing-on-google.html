        <p class="lead">You built a website. You waited. And Google acts like you don't exist. No traffic, no rankings, nothing. This is one of the most common frustrations for NH business owners — and the good news is that every cause has a fix. Here are the 15 most likely reasons your site isn't showing up, from simplest to most complex.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <strong>Quick test:</strong> Search <code>site:yourdomain.com</code> on Google right now. If zero pages appear, you have an indexing problem (reasons 1-5). If pages appear but you can't find yourself for keywords, you have a ranking problem (reasons 6-15).
        </div>

        <h2>Part 1: Google Doesn't Know You Exist (Indexing Issues)</h2>

        <h3>1. Your site is too new</h3>
        <p>Google doesn't instantly know about every new website. If you launched in the last 1-2 weeks and haven't taken any action, Google may simply not have discovered you yet.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> <a href="/blog/google-search-console-local-seo.html">Set up Google Search Console</a> and submit your XML sitemap. This directly tells Google your site exists and which pages to crawl. Most sites get indexed within 2-7 days after submission.</p>

        <h3>2. You have a noindex tag</h3>
        <p>This is more common than you'd think. Many website builders and CMS platforms have a "Discourage search engines from indexing this site" setting. If this was enabled during development and never turned off, Google is actively being told to ignore you.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Check your page source code for <code>&lt;meta name="robots" content="noindex"&gt;</code>. In WordPress, go to Settings → Reading and make sure "Discourage search engines" is unchecked. In Wix, check your SEO settings per page.</p>

        <h3>3. Your robots.txt is blocking crawlers</h3>
        <p>The <code>robots.txt</code> file tells search engines which parts of your site they can and can't access. A misconfigured file can block Google from crawling your entire site.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Visit <code>yourdomain.com/robots.txt</code> in your browser. If you see <code>Disallow: /</code> under <code>User-agent: *</code>, that's blocking everything. It should look like this:</p>
        <pre>User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml</pre>

        <h3>4. You don't have an XML sitemap</h3>
        <p>A sitemap is like a table of contents for Google. While Google can find pages without one, a sitemap ensures every page gets discovered — especially for new or small sites.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Most CMS platforms generate sitemaps automatically (check <code>yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml</code>). If yours doesn't, create one and submit it through Google Search Console.</p>

        <h3>5. No backlinks at all</h3>
        <p>Google discovers new sites partly by following links from sites it already knows. A brand new site with zero external links is harder for Google to find through normal crawling.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Get listed on at least one directory (your local Chamber of Commerce, Yelp, or Facebook Business Page). Even one link from a known site helps. See our complete <a href="/blog/get-local-backlinks-nh.html">local backlinks guide</a>.</p>

        <h2>Part 2: Google Sees You But Won't Rank You (Ranking Issues)</h2>

        <h3>6. Your content is too thin</h3>
        <p>If your pages have 50-100 words of content, Google doesn't have enough information to understand what you do or determine you're relevant for any search queries.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Each key page needs at least 500 words of unique, useful content. Service pages should describe what you offer, who it's for, your process, and your service area. Follow our <a href="/blog/service-pages-that-rank-convert.html">service page anatomy guide</a> for the complete framework.</p>

        <h3>7. You're targeting impossible keywords</h3>
        <p>Trying to rank for "plumber" nationally when you're a local business in Nashua is like entering a marathon against Olympic athletes. You need to <a href="/blog/keyword-research-local-seo.html">target keywords you can actually win</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Add location modifiers. Instead of "plumber," target "plumber Nashua NH" or "emergency plumber southern NH." Long-tail, location-specific keywords are where local businesses win. Check our <a href="/blog/local-search-intent-optimization.html">search intent guide</a> to match pages with the right keywords.</p>

        <h3>8. Your title tags are missing or generic</h3>
        <p>The title tag is the single most important on-page SEO element. If your homepage title is just "Home" or "Welcome," Google has no idea what you do.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Every page needs a unique, descriptive title tag that includes your target keyword. Formula: <code>[Service] in [City], NH — [Business Name]</code>. Keep it under 60 characters. Use our <a href="/blog/website-seo-checklist.html">SEO checklist</a> to audit all your tags.</p>

        <h3>9. Your site isn't mobile-friendly</h3>
        <p>Google uses mobile-first indexing, meaning it primarily uses the mobile version of your site for ranking. If your site doesn't work well on phones, you're at a serious disadvantage.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Test your site at Google's Mobile-Friendly Test. Common issues: text too small, clickable elements too close together, horizontal scrolling. Our <a href="/blog/mobile-friendly-website-nh.html">mobile optimization guide</a> covers every fix.</p>

        <h3>10. Your site loads too slowly</h3>
        <p>Google has confirmed site speed is a ranking factor. If your pages take more than 3 seconds to load on mobile, you're losing both rankings and visitors (53% of mobile users leave after 3 seconds).</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Test at PageSpeed Insights. The most impactful fixes: compress images, enable browser caching, minimize CSS/JavaScript, and use a decent hosting provider. Full guide: <a href="/blog/website-speed-optimization.html">website speed optimization</a>.</p>

        <h3>11. No Google Business Profile</h3>
        <p>For local businesses, not having a <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a> is like not having a phone number. It's the single most important factor for appearing in the Map Pack (the map results above organic listings).</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Create and verify your GBP. Complete every field. Add photos. Choose the most specific primary category. Start collecting <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">Google reviews</a>. The <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-tips.html">complete GBP optimization guide</a> walks through everything.</p>

        <h3>12. Duplicate content across pages</h3>
        <p>If multiple pages on your site have the same or very similar content, Google may not know which one to rank — so it may not rank any of them well.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Each page needs unique content with a unique purpose. Don't copy your homepage text onto service pages. If you serve multiple locations, don't just swap out the city name — create genuinely unique content for each <a href="/blog/local-seo-for-multiple-locations.html">location page</a>.</p>

        <h3>13. Poor internal linking</h3>
        <p>If your pages don't link to each other, Google has trouble understanding your site structure and which pages are most important. Orphan pages (pages with no internal links pointing to them) often don't rank at all.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Every page should link to at least 2-3 other pages on your site. Your homepage should link to all main service pages. Blog posts should link to relevant services. Our <a href="/blog/internal-linking-seo.html">internal linking guide</a> has the complete strategy.</p>

        <h3>14. No local signals</h3>
        <p>Google determines local relevance through a combination of signals: your address, <a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">NAP consistency</a> across directories, <a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">local citations</a>, and content that mentions your service area.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Add your full address and phone number to every page (typically in the footer). Mention your city, neighboring towns, and "NH" naturally throughout your content. Build citations on local directories. Add <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">LocalBusiness schema markup</a>.</p>

        <h3>15. Your competitors are simply stronger</h3>
        <p>Sometimes your site is doing everything right, but competitors who've been at it longer have more content, more backlinks, more reviews, and more authority. This is the hardest reason because there's no quick fix.</p>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Run a <a href="/blog/competitor-seo-analysis.html">competitor analysis</a> to see exactly where they're ahead. Then build a strategy to close the gap — usually through consistent <a href="/blog/local-seo-content-calendar.html">content publishing</a>, citation building, and review generation over 3-6 months. It's a marathon, not a sprint, but <a href="/blog/how-long-seo-takes.html">SEO compounds over time</a>.</p>

        <h2>What to Do If You've Tried Everything</h2>

        <p>If you've worked through all 15 items and still aren't seeing results, there are a few less common issues worth investigating:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manual penalty:</strong> Check Google Search Console → Security & Manual Actions for any manual penalties</li>
            <li><strong>Domain history:</strong> If you bought an expired domain, it may carry penalties from its previous owner</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript rendering:</strong> If your site is built entirely in JavaScript (React, Angular without SSR), Google may struggle to render and index your content</li>
            <li><strong>Hosting problems:</strong> If your server is frequently down or extremely slow, Google may reduce crawling</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At this point, a professional <a href="/free-audit.html">SEO audit</a> is worth the investment. Sometimes an experienced eye catches things that are invisible when you're too close to the problem.</p>

        <h2>The Fastest Path Back to Google</h2>

        <p>If we had to pick the three highest-impact actions for a local NH business that's invisible on Google:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Set up and submit to Google Search Console</strong> — this alone solves indexing issues for most sites</li>
            <li><strong>Claim and complete your Google Business Profile</strong> — the fastest path to appearing in local results</li>
            <li><strong>Add 500+ words to every page with location-specific keywords</strong> — gives Google enough content to understand your relevance</li>
        </ol>

        <p>These three steps, done well, can take you from invisible to showing up within 2-4 weeks for long-tail local keywords.</p>
