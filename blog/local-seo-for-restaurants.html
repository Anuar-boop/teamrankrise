    <p>Here's a statistic every restaurant owner needs to know: <strong>76% of people who search for a nearby restaurant visit or contact the business within a day.</strong> That's not a wish — that's a fundamental customer behavior.</p>

    <p>But here's the problem: if your restaurant doesn't show up in those search results, you don't get that traffic. Your competitors do. And you lose a dinner reservation, a family celebration, a first-time customer who would have loved your food.</p>

    <p>Restaurant local SEO isn't some advanced strategy reserved for large chains. It's the most important marketing channel for independent restaurants, food trucks, cafes, and bars. It's more direct than social media, more affordable than Google Ads, and more powerful than word-of-mouth — because Google IS where people search for food.</p>

    <p>This guide covers everything you need to rank on Google Maps, dominate "best restaurant near me" searches, and fill your tables with customers actively looking for what you serve.</p>

    <h2>Why Local SEO for Restaurants Matters More Than Anywhere Else</h2>

    <p>Local search is the cornerstone of restaurant success. Unlike national brands, you don't have customers spread across the country. You have customers within a 3-5 mile radius of your location. When someone in that radius searches for food, Google decides whether to show your restaurant or a competitor's.</p>

    <p>The stakes are high:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Competition is fierce:</strong> Most people search "best Italian restaurant near me" or "pizza delivery [city]" — not your restaurant name. You're competing against every other restaurant in your area.</li>
        <li><strong>Timing is critical:</strong> Restaurant searches happen during meal planning times — lunch, dinner, weekend. Miss the search result, and the customer goes somewhere else.</li>
        <li><strong>Review signals matter:</strong> Google uses review count, rating, and recency heavily for restaurants. A restaurant with 200+ reviews will almost always rank above one with 20, even if the latter has higher quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Menu and attributes drive conversions:</strong> People don't just want to see that you exist. They want to see your menu, delivery options, reservations availability, and hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Restaurant local SEO means mastering <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-optimization-guide.html">Google Business Profile optimization</a>, managing reviews strategically, maintaining accurate citations across platforms, and optimizing your website for local restaurant searches. It's a complete system.</p>

    <h2>Google Business Profile Optimization for Restaurants</h2>

    <p>Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is the most visible part of your restaurant on Google. It's where potential customers see your hours, menu, photos, reviews, website link, and reservation button. If this isn't optimized, you're leaving revenue on the table.</p>

    <p>Here's what every restaurant needs in their GBP:</p>

    <h3>Complete Business Information</h3>

    <p>This seems basic, but many restaurants skip it or leave gaps:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Restaurant name:</strong> Use your exact legal name. If your restaurant goes by multiple names or has a long name with taglines, avoid stuffing keywords. Google penalizes this.</li>
        <li><strong>Address:</strong> Physical address only (no PO boxes). Accuracy matters for local rankings.</li>
        <li><strong>Phone number:</strong> Single, primary phone line. If you have multiple numbers, use your main one. Consistency matters.</li>
        <li><strong>Website:</strong> Must point to a working, mobile-optimized site. <a href="/blog/website-losing-customers.html">Many restaurants' websites are outdated</a> — fix that.</li>
        <li><strong>Hours:</strong> Exact hours including holidays, special events, and any seasonal variations. Inaccurate hours is one of the top reasons people leave one-star reviews.</li>
        <li><strong>Service areas:</strong> If you deliver, specify the neighborhoods or zip codes you serve.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Restaurant Categories and Attributes</h3>

    <p>Google gives restaurants specific categories and attributes. These matter for search rankings and help customers find you.</p>

    <p><strong>Primary categories:</strong> Choose the most specific one first. "Italian restaurant" ranks differently than "pizza delivery" or "fine dining restaurant." Think about what customers search for when looking for your type of food.</p>

    <p><strong>Restaurant-specific attributes:</strong> These are the filters customers use on Google Maps. Check every box that applies to your restaurant:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Dine-in</li>
        <li>Takeout</li>
        <li>Delivery</li>
        <li>Outdoor seating</li>
        <li>Reservations available</li>
        <li>Parking available</li>
        <li>Wheelchair accessible</li>
        <li>High chairs available</li>
        <li>TV available</li>
        <li>Bar service</li>
        <li>Private dining</li>
        <li>LGBTQ+ friendly</li>
        <li>Good for kids</li>
        <li>Good for groups</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why does this matter? When someone filters Google Maps for "dine-in Italian restaurants with outdoor seating," Google needs to know you check those boxes. This is the difference between appearing and not appearing in that search.</p>

    <h3>Menu Links</h3>

    <p>One of the easiest wins: link your menu directly from your GBP. Customers can see your menu without leaving Google Maps. This dramatically increases engagement and helps with click-through rates.</p>

    <p>Upload your menu as a PDF or link to a menu page on your website. If you don't have a digital menu yet, create one. A PDF works. A web page is better (for <a href="/blog/seo-for-multiple-locations.html">multi-location restaurants</a>, each location should have its own menu page).</p>

    <h3>Food Photography</h3>

    <p><a href="/blog/rank-1-google-maps-2026.html">Google Maps is a visual medium.</a> Restaurants with professional food photography get 20-30% more click-throughs than those with low-quality images.</p>

    <p>Best practices for GBP food photos:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality over quantity:</strong> 12-15 amazing photos beat 50 mediocre ones. Use natural lighting, high resolution, and authentic food styling.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> Include signature dishes, desserts, drinks, interior shots, and team photos. Show the full restaurant experience, not just food.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it fresh:</strong> Add new photos monthly. Seasonal dishes, limited-time offerings, and special events keep your listing active and engaging.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid heavy filters:</strong> Customers want to see what they're actually getting. Light editing is fine; over-processed photos look fake.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Restaurants with consistent high-quality photos rank higher in local search and attract more reservations. This is correlation we see across hundreds of restaurant clients.</p>

    <h2>Restaurant-Specific Categories and Attributes Strategy</h2>

    <p><a href="/blog/gbp-categories-guide.html">Choosing the right restaurant category is one of the highest-impact decisions you'll make for visibility.</a></p>

    <p>Here's the strategic approach:</p>

    <h3>Primary Category</h3>

    <p>This is the main type of restaurant you are. Think about what customers search for when they want what you offer:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Search volume: "Italian restaurant" gets more searches than "Neapolitan pizzeria" (but both can work)</li>
        <li>Competition level: Broad categories have more competition; specific categories have less</li>
        <li>Your unique position: If you're a farm-to-table restaurant that focuses on sustainable ingredients, that specificity can help you rank against generic "restaurants"</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For example:</strong> If you run a Vietnamese pho restaurant, your category should be "Vietnamese restaurant" or "Pho restaurant," not just "Restaurant." Specificity drives relevance for searches like "best pho near me" or "Vietnamese delivery."</p>

    <h3>Secondary Categories</h3>

    <p>You can add up to 9 categories total. Use these to capture additional search intent:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Fast food / quick service variant: "Fast casual restaurant"</li>
        <li>Dining style: "Fine dining restaurant" or "Casual restaurant"</li>
        <li>Service type: "Pizza delivery" or "Sushi takeout"</li>
        <li>Special focus: "Vegetarian restaurant" or "Gluten-free restaurant"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The goal: cover the major searches your target customers make without stuffing keywords artificially.</p>

    <h3>Attributes Strategy</h3>

    <p>Only check attributes that are true. But make sure you check every legitimate one. If you have outdoor seating but didn't check the box, you're invisible to customers filtering for that.</p>

    <p>Common attributes that drive searches:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Takeout/Delivery:</strong> Critical post-pandemic. If you offer this, highlight it.</li>
        <li><strong>Dine-in:</strong> Still the primary experience for most restaurants.</li>
        <li><strong>Reservations:</strong> If you accept them (or use a platform like OpenTable), this is huge for fine dining.</li>
        <li><strong>Outdoor seating:</strong> Weather-dependent, but highly searched for casual dining.</li>
        <li><strong>Wheelchair accessible:</strong> ADA compliance is non-negotiable and improves visibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Good for kids/groups:</strong> Helps you rank for family searches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Menu Optimization and Structured Data</h2>

    <p>Your menu is a critical SEO asset. It's not just food descriptions — it's a ranking signal.</p>

    <h3>Menu Page Optimization</h3>

    <p><a href="/blog/gbp-categories-guide.html">Your website should have a dedicated menu page</a> (or pages for multi-location restaurants). This page should:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Include actual text, not just a PDF:</strong> PDFs can't be crawled effectively by Google. If you have a PDF, also include the menu categories and item names in HTML text.</li>
        <li><strong>Organize by category:</strong> Appetizers, entrees, desserts, drinks, specials. Use heading tags (h3) for categories.</li>
        <li><strong>Include descriptions:</strong> "Grilled branzino with seasonal vegetables and lemon butter sauce" beats just "Branzino $28."</li>
        <li><strong>Add prices:</strong> Important for customer decision-making.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight specials and signature dishes:</strong> These change and Google loves fresh content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Menu Schema Markup</h3>

    <p><a href="/blog/google-reviews-ranking-factor.html">Structured data helps Google understand your content.</a> For restaurants, implement Menu schema markup:</p>

    <div style="background: var(--bg-surface); border: 1px solid var(--border); border-radius: var(--radius-lg); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-size: 0.9rem; overflow-x: auto;">
        <p style="margin: 0; color: var(--text-secondary); font-family: monospace;">
            &lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;<br>
            {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;"@context": "https://schema.org",<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;"@type": "Restaurant",<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Your Restaurant Name",<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;"image": "https://example.com/logo.jpg",<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;"priceRange": "$$",<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;"address": { ... },<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;"menu": "https://example.com/menu",<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;"servesCuisine": ["Italian", "Pizza"]<br>
            }<br>
            &lt;/script&gt;
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>This tells Google exactly what you are, what cuisine you serve, your price range, and where your menu lives. It improves rich snippets in search results and helps with <a href="/blog/local-seo-checklist-2026.html">local SEO overall.</a></p>

    <h2>Photo Optimization Strategy</h2>

    <p>Photos are the visual representation of your restaurant. They drive engagement, clicks, and conversions.</p>

    <h3>Food Photography Fundamentals</h3>

    <p><strong>Professional quality matters:</strong> If your budget allows, hire a professional food photographer once per quarter. The photos they produce will outperform amateur shots by 3-5x in engagement.</p>

    <p>If you're doing it yourself:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Natural lighting is everything:</strong> Shoot near windows, not under fluorescent lights. Golden hour (late afternoon) is best.</li>
        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> 45-degree angle shots look better than flat shots. Include depth — foreground (food), mid-ground (plate/setting), background (restaurant ambiance).</li>
        <li><strong>Color grading:</strong> Make food look fresh and appetizing. Warm tones for comfort food, bright whites for fresh/healthy options.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid stock photos:</strong> They're generic and customers can tell. Real food from real customers converts better.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Photo Variety Strategy</h3>

    <p>Your GBP should include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>5-7 signature dishes:</strong> Your best-sellers, most photogenic items</li>
        <li><strong>2-3 interior shots:</strong> Dining area, bar, private dining space. Show ambiance and cleanliness.</li>
        <li><strong>1-2 exterior/storefront:</strong> This is the first impression. Make it welcoming.</li>
        <li><strong>1 team photo:</strong> People-focused restaurants benefit from team photos. Shows personality and builds trust.</li>
        <li><strong>Special items:</strong> Desserts, drinks, seasonal specials. Variety keeps people engaging with your profile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Updating Photos for Freshness</h3>

    <p>Add 3-5 new photos per month. This signals activity to Google and keeps your listing from becoming stale. Seasonal menus are perfect for this — fall specials, summer drinks, holiday dishes.</p>

    <p>Google's algorithm favors fresh listings. A restaurant that uploads a new menu photo in February, March, and April will rank higher than one that uploads everything in January and goes silent.</p>

    <h2>Review Management and Strategy</h2>

    <p><a href="/blog/google-reviews-ranking-factor.html">Reviews are one of the top ranking factors for local search.</a> For restaurants specifically, they're a customer magnet — people use reviews to decide where to eat.</p>

    <h3>Building a Review Generation System</h3>

    <p>Don't wait for reviews to happen naturally. Build a system:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ask in person:</strong> After a great meal, the server mentions it: "If you enjoyed your experience, a Google review would help us a lot. Here's a QR code to make it easy."</li>
        <li><strong>Follow-up emails:</strong> Send within 24 hours of reservation (for OpenTable diners) with a direct link to leave a review.</li>
        <li><strong>Text message reminders:</strong> If you collect phone numbers, a simple text after dining asking for a review gets 15-20% response rates.</li>
        <li><strong>QR code cards:</strong> Place small cards on tables with a QR code to your review page. Make it instant.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Target: aim for 3-5 new reviews per week if you're a small restaurant. That's 150+ per year, which will put you ahead of 95% of local competitors.</p>

    <h3>Responding to Reviews</h3>

    <p>Every review deserves a response. This is critical:</p>

    <p><strong>For positive reviews:</strong> Keep it genuine and specific.</p>

    <div style="background: var(--bg-surface); border: 1px solid var(--border); border-radius: var(--radius-lg); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <p style="margin: 0; color: var(--text-secondary); font-style: italic;">
            "Thanks, Sarah! So glad you loved the branzino. We love seeing families enjoy a great meal together. Hope to see you again soon!"
        </p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>For negative reviews:</strong> Stay professional. Never argue publicly. Offer to fix it offline.</p>

    <div style="background: var(--bg-surface); border: 1px solid var(--border); border-radius: var(--radius-lg); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <p style="margin: 0; color: var(--text-secondary); font-style: italic;">
            "Hi Marcus, we're sorry your experience didn't meet our standards. This isn't typical, and we'd like to make it right. Please reach out at [phone] — Manager Sarah would like to talk with you."
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>Responding to reviews signals engagement to Google and shows potential customers that you care. Restaurants with consistent response rates see 20-30% higher rankings for competitive local keywords.</p>

    <h2>Local Citations for Restaurants</h2>

    <p><a href="/blog/local-citations-nap-consistency.html">Citations are mentions of your business on other websites.</a> For restaurants, the big platforms matter:</p>

    <h3>Priority Citations</h3>

    <p>These should be your first targets:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Business Profile:</strong> Your #1 citation source. Keep it updated constantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Yelp:</strong> The #2 platform for restaurant searches. Huge volume. Verify your page and optimize it like a GBP profile.</li>
        <li><strong>TripAdvisor:</strong> Still relevant for travelers and fine dining research.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenTable:</strong> If you take reservations, this is critical. Most diners check OpenTable before booking.</li>
        <li><strong>DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub:</strong> If you deliver, these platforms are must-haves. They're actually search platforms themselves (people search within them), not just citations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Secondary Platforms</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Local Chamber of Commerce websites</li>
        <li>City directories and "Best of" lists</li>
        <li>Food blogger sites and local restaurant guides</li>
        <li>Event platforms (if you host events)</li>
        <li>Delivery aggregators specific to your region</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Citation Consistency</h3>

    <p>Your restaurant name, address, phone number, and website must be identical across all platforms. Google uses NAP consistency as a ranking signal. If you're listed as "Joe's Italian Kitchen" on Google but "Joes Italian" on Yelp, Google notes the inconsistency.</p>

    <p>Audit your citations quarterly. Make sure everything matches.</p>

    <h2>Website SEO for Restaurants</h2>

    <p><a href="/blog/website-losing-customers.html">Many restaurants lose customers because their website is outdated or hard to navigate.</a></p>

    <h3>Essential Website Elements</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Menu page:</strong> As discussed, must be text-based with descriptions and prices, not just a PDF.</li>
        <li><strong>Hours and location:</strong> Frontmost and obvious. Not hidden on a separate page.</li>
        <li><strong>Reservation system:</strong> Links to OpenTable, Resy, or your own booking system. Make booking frictionless.</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery/Ordering links:</strong> Direct links to DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub, or your own ordering system.</li>
        <li><strong>About page:</strong> Tell your restaurant's story. Local searches favor businesses with history and personality in their content.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact information:</strong> Phone number, email, physical address, hours. Prominence matters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mobile Optimization</h3>

    <p>70%+ of restaurant searches happen on mobile. Your website must be mobile-first:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Fast loading (under 2 seconds)</li>
        <li>Touch-friendly buttons and links (no tiny text)</li>
        <li>One-click calls to order or book reservations</li>
        <li>Quick navigation to your menu and hours</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Multi-Location Restaurants</h3>

    <p><a href="/blog/seo-for-multiple-locations.html">Multi-location restaurants need location pages for each restaurant.</a> Each location page should have:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Address and unique hours for that location</li>
        <li>Location-specific menu variations (if any)</li>
        <li>Manager/team photos and contact info</li>
        <li>Local reviews aggregated for that location</li>
        <li>Local schema markup for that specific address</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This helps Google understand that you're a legitimate multi-location business and helps each location rank individually for local searches.</p>

    <h2>Social Media Signals</h2>

    <p>Social media doesn't directly impact local search rankings, but it does impact your business in ways that drive SEO:</p>

    <h3>Instagram for Restaurants</h3>

    <p>Instagram is where restaurant customers live. Beautiful food photos, behind-the-scenes content, and customer posts drive brand awareness and foot traffic.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Post 3-4x per week:</strong> New menu items, daily specials, customer photos (tag them), team highlights.</li>
        <li><strong>Use location tags:</strong> Geotag your restaurant location on every post. This signals local relevance to the algorithm.</li>
        <li><strong>Encourage reviews:</strong> Ask followers to leave Google reviews. Include your review link in bio.</li>
        <li><strong>Stories and Reels:</strong> Short video content performs best. Show preparation, plating, customer reactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Facebook for Restaurants</h3>

    <p>Facebook is still critical for local reach, especially for older demographics:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Match your GBP info exactly:</strong> Hours, phone, address, website. Consistency matters.</li>
        <li><strong>Post menu updates:</strong> Specials, seasonal items, limited-time offerings.</li>
        <li><strong>Event promotion:</strong> Live music, trivia nights, happy hours. These drive foot traffic and engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Reviews section:</strong> Like Google, ensure reviews are responded to.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tracking and Measuring Results</h2>

    <p>You can't improve what you don't measure. Here's what restaurant owners should track:</p>

    <h3>Primary Metrics</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Maps views:</strong> Go to your Google Business Profile insights. How many people are seeing your profile each month?</li>
        <li><strong>Direction requests:</strong> How many people clicked for directions? This shows intent.</li>
        <li><strong>Phone calls:</strong> Track calls from your GBP specifically (Google provides this data). This is direct ROI.</li>
        <li><strong>Website clicks:</strong> How many people visited your website from Google? This metric is in GBP insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Review count and rating:</strong> Track these weekly. Are you gaining reviews? Is your average rating improving?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Secondary Metrics</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reservation increases:</strong> Use OpenTable or your booking system to track new reservations. Month-over-month growth is the real metric.</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery orders:</strong> If applicable, track orders from DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub specifically. Are they increasing?</li>
        <li><strong>Search rank:</strong> Tool like Semrush or Bright Local can track your search rank for local keywords like "best Italian restaurant [city]" or "pizza delivery near me."</li>
        <li><strong>Website traffic:</strong> Google Analytics should show local organic traffic trends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Simple Monthly Tracking</h3>

    <p>Create a simple spreadsheet:</p>

    <div style="background: var(--bg-surface); border: 1px solid var(--border); border-radius: var(--radius-lg); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <p style="margin: 0; color: var(--text-secondary); font-size: 0.9rem;">
            <strong>Month:</strong> [Month]<br>
            GBP Views: [#]<br>
            Phone Calls: [#]<br>
            Website Clicks: [#]<br>
            Direction Requests: [#]<br>
            Reviews (Count/Rating): [#]/[★]<br>
            Reservations: [#]<br>
            Delivery Orders: [#]<br>
            Notes: [Any changes to menu, hours, or marketing?]
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>Track this monthly for 6 months. You'll see if your local SEO efforts are working. If views and calls are flat, you need to adjust strategy. If they're growing 15-20% month-over-month, keep doing what you're doing.</p>

    <h2>The Complete Restaurant Local SEO Checklist</h2>

    <p>Before you launch or optimize, use this checklist:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>☐ <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-optimization-guide.html">Google Business Profile fully optimized</a> (complete info, categories, attributes, menu link)</li>
        <li>☐ Food photography uploaded (12-15 high-quality images minimum)</li>
        <li>☐ Hours and attributes reviewed for accuracy</li>
        <li>☐ <a href="/blog/rank-1-google-maps-2026.html">Service areas and delivery zones specified</a></li>
        <li>☐ Menu page on website (text-based, not PDF)</li>
        <li>☐ Restaurant schema markup implemented</li>
        <li>☐ <a href="/blog/local-citations-nap-consistency.html">NAP consistency across all platforms</a> (Google, Yelp, OpenTable, delivery apps)</li>
        <li>☐ Review generation system in place (cards, emails, in-person asks)</li>
        <li>☐ Responding to all reviews (positive and negative)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>What Not to Do</h2>

    <p>Avoid these SEO mistakes that restaurants commonly make:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stuffing keywords in your restaurant name:</strong> "Joe's Best Pizza | Pizza Delivery | Italian Restaurant" will get flagged by Google. Use your actual business name.</li>
        <li><strong>Offering incentives for reviews:</strong> "Leave a Google review and get 20% off" violates Google's policies. Reviews get removed and your profile can be suspended.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring negative reviews:</strong> They won't go away. Respond professionally and work to fix the underlying issue.</li>
        <li><strong>Inconsistent information across platforms:</strong> "Joe's Pizza" on Google, "Joes Pizza Inc" on Yelp, and "JOES PIZZA" on OpenTable confuses Google and hurts rankings.</li>
        <li><strong>Not responding to customers:</strong> If someone messages you on Google or Facebook and you ignore them, that damages your reputation and conversions.</li>
        <li><strong>Outdated or broken website:</strong> <a href="/blog/website-losing-customers.html">Your website is losing you customers</a> if it's slow, hard to navigate, or has broken links.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary: The Restaurant Local SEO Roadmap</h2>

    <p>Restaurant local SEO isn't complicated, but it is systematic. Here's the priority order:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Optimize your Google Business Profile completely (info, categories, attributes, menu, photos)</li>
        <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Ensure website is mobile-optimized with working menu, reservations, and delivery links</li>
        <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Implement schema markup on your website menu page</li>
        <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Audit and fix NAP consistency across Yelp, OpenTable, delivery platforms, and local directories</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Generate 3-5 reviews per week through systematic asking, respond to all reviews, upload fresh photos monthly, track metrics</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you do these things consistently for 90 days, you'll see meaningful results: more visibility in Google Maps, more phone calls, more reservations, more customers discovering you.</p>
