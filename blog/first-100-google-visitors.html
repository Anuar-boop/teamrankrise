        <p class="lead">You launched your website. It looks great. But nobody's visiting. Google seems to be ignoring you completely. Sound familiar? Here's the exact playbook to go from zero to your first 100 organic visitors — and build momentum that compounds from there.</p>

        <h2>Why 100 Visitors Is the Milestone That Matters</h2>

        <p>One hundred visitors from Google might not sound like much. But for a local business, it represents something critical: <strong>proof that Google knows you exist and considers you relevant</strong>.</p>

        <p>Here's what 100 organic visitors typically means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You're indexed</strong> — Google has crawled and stored your pages</li>
            <li><strong>You're ranking for something</strong> — even if it's long-tail keywords</li>
            <li><strong>Your site works technically</strong> — fast enough, mobile-friendly, no major errors</li>
            <li><strong>You have content worth showing</strong> — Google trusts your relevance</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For a local NH business, 100 organic visitors per month often translates to 5-15 phone calls or form submissions. At a 2-3% conversion rate on a <a href="/blog/landing-page-optimization.html">well-optimized landing page</a>, that's real revenue from day one.</p>

        <h2>The Timeline: How Long Does It Take?</h2>

        <p>Let's set realistic expectations. Here's what we typically see for new NH business websites:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Phase</th>
                    <th>Timeline</th>
                    <th>Expected Visitors</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Indexed by Google</td>
                    <td>1-2 weeks</td>
                    <td>0-5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>First rankings appear</td>
                    <td>2-6 weeks</td>
                    <td>5-20</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Long-tail traffic starts</td>
                    <td>1-3 months</td>
                    <td>20-60</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hit 100 monthly visitors</td>
                    <td>2-4 months</td>
                    <td>100+</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Consistent growth phase</td>
                    <td>4-8 months</td>
                    <td>200-500+</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>This timeline assumes you're actively working on SEO — not just publishing a site and hoping. Businesses that follow the steps below reach 100 visitors significantly faster. Learn more about realistic timelines in our <a href="/blog/how-long-seo-takes.html">how long SEO takes</a> guide.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Make Sure Google Can Find You</h2>

        <p>Before anything else, your site needs to be discoverable. Many new sites fail here without realizing it.</p>

        <h3>Submit your sitemap to Google Search Console</h3>
        <p>This is the single most impactful thing you can do on day one. <a href="/blog/google-search-console-local-seo.html">Set up Google Search Console</a>, verify ownership, and submit your XML sitemap. This tells Google exactly which pages you want indexed.</p>

        <h3>Check your robots.txt</h3>
        <p>Make sure your robots.txt file isn't accidentally blocking Google. A common mistake with new WordPress or Wix sites is leaving "noindex" tags from the development phase.</p>

        <h3>Get your first backlink</h3>
        <p>Google discovers new sites partly by following links from sites it already knows. Getting listed on just one reputable directory (your local Chamber of Commerce, for example) can speed up discovery significantly.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <strong>Quick check:</strong> Search <code>site:yourdomain.com</code> on Google. If zero results appear, you're not indexed yet. If your pages show up, you've passed step 1.
        </div>

        <h2>Step 2: Nail Your Homepage SEO</h2>

        <p>Your homepage will likely be your first page to rank. Make it count.</p>

        <h3>The essential elements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Title tag:</strong> "[Your Service] in [City], NH — [Business Name]" (under 60 characters)</li>
            <li><strong>Meta description:</strong> What you do + where + why choose you (under 155 characters)</li>
            <li><strong>H1 heading:</strong> Your primary service + location</li>
            <li><strong>First paragraph:</strong> Naturally include your main keyword within the first 100 words</li>
            <li><strong>Phone number:</strong> Clickable <code>tel:</code> link, visible above the fold</li>
            <li><strong>NAP:</strong> Name, address, phone — consistent with your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Content depth matters</h3>
        <p>A homepage with 100 words won't rank. Aim for 500-800 words that describe your services, service area, and what makes you different. This isn't just for Google — visitors need this information to decide whether to call you. Check our <a href="/blog/seo-friendly-content-writing.html">content writing guide</a> for specific techniques.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Create Your Core Service Pages</h2>

        <p>Your homepage can't rank for everything. You need dedicated pages for each service. Learn the full framework in our <a href="/blog/service-pages-that-rank-convert.html">service page guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>One page per service</h3>
        <p>If you offer three services, you need three service pages. Each one targets a different keyword:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>/residential-plumbing.html</code> → "residential plumbing [city] NH"</li>
            <li><code>/commercial-plumbing.html</code> → "commercial plumber [city] NH"</li>
            <li><code>/emergency-plumbing.html</code> → "emergency plumber [city] NH"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Minimum viable content per page</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500+ words of unique content</li>
            <li>3-5 subheadings (H2/H3) using related keywords</li>
            <li>A clear call-to-action (phone number or contact form)</li>
            <li>Your service area mentioned naturally</li>
            <li><a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">LocalBusiness schema markup</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 4: Claim and Optimize Google Business Profile</h2>

        <p>For local businesses, your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a> is just as important as your website — maybe more. Here's why:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>GBP listings appear above organic results in the Map Pack</li>
            <li>Your GBP sends trust signals that boost your website rankings</li>
            <li>It's free — and most of your competitors haven't fully optimized theirs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The 80/20 of GBP optimization</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Complete every single field (description, hours, services, attributes)</li>
            <li>Choose the most specific primary category</li>
            <li>Add 10+ photos of your actual work, team, and location</li>
            <li>Get your first 5 <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">Google reviews</a></li>
            <li>Post weekly using <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-posts.html">GBP posts</a></li>
        </ol>

        <p>A fully optimized GBP can drive traffic to your website even before your site ranks organically. It's the fastest path to those first visitors.</p>

        <h2>Step 5: Build Your First 5 Citations</h2>

        <p><a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">Citations</a> (mentions of your business name, address, and phone on other websites) tell Google you're a legitimate local business.</p>

        <h3>Start with these 5 free directories</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Google Business Profile</strong> (already done in step 4)</li>
            <li><strong>Yelp</strong> — claim your listing, complete your profile</li>
            <li><strong>Facebook Business Page</strong> — even if you don't plan to post regularly</li>
            <li><strong>Apple Maps / Apple Business Connect</strong> — growing in importance</li>
            <li><strong>Your local Chamber of Commerce</strong> — often includes a backlink</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The key rule: your name, address, and phone must be <a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">exactly the same</a> everywhere. "123 Main St" on one site and "123 Main Street" on another confuses Google.</p>

        <h2>Step 6: Publish Your First Blog Post</h2>

        <p>Your service pages target "money keywords" (people ready to buy). Blog posts target "informational keywords" (people researching). Both matter for reaching 100 visitors. See our <a href="/blog/local-seo-content-calendar.html">content calendar guide</a> for planning.</p>

        <h3>Your first post should answer your most common customer question</h3>
        <p>Think about what customers ask you every week. That question is your first blog post. Examples:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>"How much does [service] cost in [city]?" — <a href="/blog/seo-cost-nh-small-business.html">like this example</a></li>
            <li>"How to choose a [service provider] in [area]?" — <a href="/blog/how-to-choose-seo-agency-nh.html">like this one</a></li>
            <li>"What's the difference between [option A] and [option B]?"</li>
            <li>"How long does [process] take?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Blog post minimum requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>800+ words (aim for 1,200-1,500 for best results)</li>
            <li>Answer the question thoroughly — don't hold back useful information</li>
            <li>Include 2-3 <a href="/blog/internal-linking-seo.html">internal links</a> to your service pages</li>
            <li>Add a call-to-action at the bottom</li>
            <li>Use <a href="/blog/keyword-research-local-seo.html">keyword research</a> to target terms people actually search</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 7: Get Your First 3 Google Reviews</h2>

        <p>Reviews don't directly bring website visitors, but they dramatically impact your click-through rate from search results. A business with 4.5 stars and 10 reviews gets significantly more clicks than one with zero reviews.</p>

        <p>Read our complete guide to <a href="/blog/first-50-google-reviews.html">getting your first 50 reviews</a> and our strategies for <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">generating reviews consistently</a>.</p>

        <h3>The simplest approach that works</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a direct review link from your GBP dashboard</li>
            <li>After completing good work, text or email the link with: "Thanks for choosing us! If you had a good experience, a quick Google review would mean a lot to our small business."</li>
            <li>Make it easy — one click to the review form</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Don't overthink this. Three genuine reviews from real customers in your first month puts you ahead of many competitors who have zero.</p>

        <h2>Step 8: Fix Technical Basics</h2>

        <p>Technical issues silently kill new sites. Run through these checks:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mobile-friendly:</strong> Test at <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" rel="noopener">Google's Mobile Test</a>. Over 60% of local searches happen on phones. See our <a href="/blog/mobile-friendly-website-nh.html">mobile optimization guide</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Page speed:</strong> Under 3 seconds on mobile. Use <a href="/blog/website-speed-optimization.html">our speed guide</a> to fix common issues.</li>
            <li><strong>SSL certificate:</strong> Your URL must start with <code>https://</code>. Free through most hosts.</li>
            <li><strong>No broken links:</strong> Check with a free tool like Broken Link Checker</li>
            <li><strong>Sitemap submitted:</strong> Back to <a href="/blog/google-search-console-local-seo.html">Search Console</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 9: Build One Quality Backlink</h2>

        <p>For a new site, even one backlink from a relevant local source can make a measurable difference. Check our full <a href="/blog/get-local-backlinks-nh.html">local backlinks guide</a> for strategies.</p>

        <h3>Easiest first backlinks for local businesses</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>NH Chamber of Commerce</strong> — most include a member directory with links</li>
            <li><strong>NH.gov business directory</strong> — if applicable to your industry</li>
            <li><strong>Local newspaper</strong> — submit a press release about your launch</li>
            <li><strong>Partner businesses</strong> — if a complementary business links to you, that counts</li>
            <li><strong>Sponsor a local event</strong> — most event pages link to sponsors</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Step 10: Track and Iterate</h2>

        <p>You can't improve what you don't measure. Set up basic tracking so you know when you hit 100.</p>

        <h3>Free tools to install on day one</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Search Console</strong> — shows which queries bring visitors and your average position. Our <a href="/blog/google-search-console-local-seo.html">GSC guide</a> walks through setup.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics</strong> — shows total visitors, which pages they view, and where they come from. See our <a href="/blog/google-analytics-local-business.html">GA setup guide</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to check weekly</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Total organic visitors (Google Analytics → Acquisition → Organic Search)</li>
            <li>Which pages get the most traffic</li>
            <li>Which search queries are driving impressions (Search Console → Performance)</li>
            <li><a href="/blog/track-seo-results.html">Keyword position changes</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Using data to reach 100 faster</h3>
        <p>After 2-4 weeks, Search Console will show "striking distance" keywords — queries where you rank on page 2 (positions 11-20). These are your biggest opportunity. A small content update or one more backlink can push them to page 1, where 95% of clicks happen.</p>

        <h2>The 30-Day Action Plan</h2>

        <p>Here's everything above condensed into a weekly plan:</p>

        <table>

        <p>Continue publishing one blog post per week and building 1-2 citations/backlinks per week. Most local businesses following this plan reach 100 monthly visitors within 60-90 days.</p>

        <h2>Common Mistakes That Delay Your First 100 Visitors</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Targeting impossible keywords:</strong> "plumber" is too broad. "Emergency plumber Manchester NH" is achievable. Use our <a href="/blog/keyword-research-local-seo.html">keyword research guide</a> to find realistic targets.</li>
            <li><strong>Thin pages:</strong> Pages with 50-100 words won't rank. Google needs substance to understand your relevance.</li>
            <li><strong>Ignoring GBP:</strong> For local businesses, GBP often drives more early traffic than your website itself.</li>
            <li><strong>No internal links:</strong> Orphan pages (pages with no links pointing to them) take much longer to rank. <a href="/blog/internal-linking-seo.html">Link your pages together</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Giving up too soon:</strong> SEO compounds. <a href="/blog/how-long-seo-takes.html">Month 1 is always the slowest</a>. The growth curve is exponential, not linear.</li>
            <li><strong>DIY mistakes:</strong> Common <a href="/blog/diy-seo-mistakes.html">DIY SEO errors</a> can actually hurt your rankings if you're not careful.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>After 100: What Changes?</h2>

        <p>Once you hit 100 monthly organic visitors, the game shifts:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Content compounds:</strong> Each new blog post builds on existing authority, ranking faster</li>
            <li><strong>Google trusts you more:</strong> New pages get indexed within hours instead of days</li>
            <li><strong>You have data:</strong> Enough traffic to identify your best-converting pages and keywords</li>
            <li><strong>Reviews accumulate:</strong> More customers means more review opportunities</li>
            <li><strong>Competitors notice:</strong> You start appearing in their <a href="/blog/competitor-seo-analysis.html">competitor analysis</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The jump from 100 to 500 visitors typically takes less time than the jump from 0 to 100. That's the power of SEO momentum.</p>

        <h2>Get There Faster</h2>
