        <p>Here's a stat that should stop you in your tracks: <strong>over 60% of Google searches now happen on phones</strong>. For local searches — "plumber near me," "best pizza in Nashua," "dentist Manchester NH" — that number jumps even higher.</p>

        <p>And since 2021, Google has used <strong>mobile-first indexing</strong> for every website on the internet. That means Google ranks your <em>mobile</em> site, not your desktop site. If your mobile experience is bad, your rankings suffer — even if your desktop site looks beautiful.</p>

        <p>We've audited hundreds of NH business websites. Roughly 40% have serious mobile usability issues that are actively costing them customers and rankings.</p>

        <h2>What "Mobile-Friendly" Actually Means in 2026</h2>

        <p>Mobile-friendly isn't just "the site loads on my phone." It means:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Text is readable without zooming</strong> — body text at 16px minimum, not the 12px that looks fine on desktop</li>
            <li><strong>Buttons and links are tappable</strong> — at least 44x44px tap targets with adequate spacing between them</li>
            <li><strong>Content fits the screen</strong> — no horizontal scrolling required, images resize to viewport width</li>
            <li><strong>Pages load fast</strong> — under 3 seconds on a typical mobile connection (not just WiFi)</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation works</strong> — menu is accessible, doesn't break, doesn't cover content</li>
            <li><strong>Forms are usable</strong> — input fields are large enough, correct keyboard types appear (number pad for phone fields)</li>
            <li><strong>No intrusive popups</strong> — Google penalizes "intrusive interstitials" that cover mobile content</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The 7 Most Common Mobile Problems We Find on NH Business Websites</h2>

        <h3>1. The Website Was Built for Desktop First (or Only)</h3>

        <p>This is the most common issue by far. Many NH small businesses had their website built 5-8 years ago when "responsive design" was an afterthought. The site technically shrinks to fit a phone, but the experience is terrible: tiny text, buttons too close together, images that stretch the page.</p>

        <p>If your site was built before 2018, there's a good chance it falls into this category. Check our <a href="/blog/website-seo-checklist.html">SEO checklist</a> to see if your site passes basic standards.</p>

        <h3>2. Slow Load Times on Mobile Networks</h3>

        <p>Your site might load instantly on your office WiFi. But your customers are searching on their phones — often on 4G or spotty connections at job sites, in cars, or walking down Main Street in <a href="/seo-concord-nh.html">Concord</a>.</p>

        <p>Common speed killers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uncompressed images (a single 3MB hero image can take 8+ seconds on 4G)</li>
            <li>Too many fonts loaded (each font file is 50-150KB)</li>
            <li>Heavy JavaScript frameworks for simple brochure sites</li>
            <li>No browser caching configured</li>
            <li>Cheap shared hosting with slow response times</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Google's data:</strong> 53% of mobile visitors abandon a page that takes longer than 3 seconds to load. Every second of delay costs you conversions.</p>

        <h3>3. Tap Targets Too Small or Too Close Together</h3>

        <p>Can a person with average-sized thumbs easily tap your phone number link? Your navigation menu items? Your "Get a Quote" button? If links are clustered together, visitors will tap the wrong one — and many won't bother trying again.</p>

        <p>The fix is simple: make all clickable elements at least 44px tall and wide, with at least 8px spacing between them. Your <a href="/blog/website-losing-customers.html">website might be losing customers</a> just because buttons are frustrating to use on phones.</p>

        <h3>4. Phone Number Not Clickable</h3>

        <p>This one is almost criminal for a local business. Someone finds your site on their phone, sees your phone number, and... can't tap it to call you. The number is displayed as plain text instead of a <code>tel:</code> link.</p>

        <p>Every phone number on your website should be wrapped in a link: <code>&lt;a href="tel:+16035551234"&gt;(603) 555-1234&lt;/a&gt;</code>. Period. No exceptions.</p>

        <h3>5. Contact Form Unusable on Mobile</h3>

        <p>Desktop forms with wide input fields, date pickers, and multi-column layouts break on phones. Fields overflow the screen, dropdown menus are impossible to use, and "Submit" buttons end up hidden below the fold.</p>

        <p>Mobile forms should be single-column, with large input fields and the minimum number of required fields. If you're asking for more than name, phone, email, and a message field, you're asking too much on mobile.</p>

        <h3>6. Pop-ups and Overlays That Block Content</h3>

        <p>Google has specifically penalized mobile sites that use "intrusive interstitials" since 2017. If your site shows a full-screen popup, email capture overlay, or cookie banner that covers most of the content on mobile, you're being penalized in search results.</p>

        <p>Small banners at the top or bottom are fine. Full-screen overlays on mobile are not. Remove them or make them dismissible with a large, easy-to-tap close button.</p>

        <h3>7. Missing Viewport Meta Tag</h3>

        <p>This is a technical issue that's easy to miss. Without the viewport meta tag, mobile browsers render your page at desktop width and zoom out — making everything tiny. Every page needs this in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:</p>

        <p><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code></p>

        <p>It's one line of code, but without it, nothing else you do for mobile matters. Our <a href="/services.html#technical">technical SEO audit</a> catches this and dozens of other issues.</p>

        <h2>How to Test Your Website's Mobile-Friendliness</h2>

        <p>You don't need to hire an agency to check this. Here are free tools you can use right now:</p>

        <h3>Google's Own Tools</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Search Console</strong> — the "Mobile Usability" report shows every page with mobile issues. If you haven't set this up yet, read our guide on <a href="/blog/why-nh-business-not-on-google.html">why your business isn't showing up on Google</a></li>
            <li><strong>PageSpeed Insights</strong> — enter your URL and check the "Mobile" tab for performance scores and specific recommendations</li>
            <li><strong>Lighthouse (built into Chrome)</strong> — right-click any page, "Inspect," then run a Lighthouse audit for mobile</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Manual Test</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your website on your actual phone (not a desktop browser resized)</li>
            <li>Can you read all text without zooming?</li>
            <li>Can you tap every link and button without accidentally hitting something else?</li>
            <li>Can you fill out your contact form without frustration?</li>
            <li>Does the page load in under 3 seconds?</li>
            <li>Can you find your phone number and tap to call?</li>
            <li>Does the navigation menu work smoothly?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you answered "no" to even one of these, you have a problem worth fixing.</p>

        <h2>Why This Matters Even More for Local NH Businesses</h2>

        <p>Local searches have the highest mobile percentage of any search type. When someone in <a href="/seo-manchester-nh.html">Manchester</a> searches "emergency plumber" at 10pm, they're on their phone. When a homeowner in <a href="/seo-dover-nh.html">Dover</a> searches "landscaper near me" while standing in their yard, they're on their phone.</p>

        <p>These are high-intent searches. The person wants to hire someone <em>right now</em>. If your site is frustrating on mobile, they're going to your competitor who has a fast, clean, mobile-friendly site with a clickable phone number.</p>

        <p>The <a href="/blog/google-maps-ranking-nh.html">Google Map Pack</a> — those top 3 business listings with the map — is also heavily influenced by mobile usability. Google wants to show searchers businesses with good mobile experiences because most Map Pack clicks come from phones.</p>

        <h2>What to Fix First: A Priority List</h2>

        <p>If your site has multiple mobile issues, fix them in this order:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Viewport meta tag</strong> — if missing, nothing else works. 2-minute fix.</li>
            <li><strong>Clickable phone number</strong> — this directly generates calls. 5-minute fix.</li>
            <li><strong>Page speed</strong> — compress images, enable caching. 1-2 hours if you know what you're doing.</li>
            <li><strong>Tap target sizes</strong> — increase button and link sizes to 44px minimum. 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive layout</strong> — if your site isn't responsive at all, this may require a rebuild. But if it's just slightly broken, CSS media queries can fix most issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove intrusive popups</strong> — delete or redesign mobile popups. 30 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact form redesign</strong> — simplify to single-column, reduce fields. 1-2 hours.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The ROI of Going Mobile-Friendly</h2>

        <p>Here's what businesses typically see after fixing mobile issues:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>15-30% increase in mobile traffic</strong> — better rankings for the 60%+ of searches happening on phones</li>
            <li><strong>20-40% lower bounce rate</strong> — visitors stay instead of hitting "back" in frustration</li>
            <li><strong>25-50% more phone calls</strong> — clickable numbers + better user experience = more conversions</li>
            <li><strong>Higher Google rankings across the board</strong> — mobile-first indexing means mobile fixes improve ALL your rankings</li>
        </ul>

        <p>One <a href="/seo-nashua-nh.html">Nashua</a> restaurant we worked with saw phone calls from their website jump 38% in the first month after we fixed their mobile issues. Their organic traffic increased 22% the following month as Google re-crawled the improved pages.</p>

        <p>These aren't hypothetical benefits. They're what happens when you stop turning away the majority of your potential customers. For context on how quickly SEO improvements show results, see our timeline guide on <a href="/blog/how-long-seo-takes.html">how long SEO takes</a>.</p>

        <h2>Should You Fix Your Current Site or Rebuild?</h2>

        <p>If your site was built in the last 3-4 years with a modern platform (WordPress with a recent theme, Squarespace, Wix), it probably just needs tune-ups: image compression, font loading, tap target fixes.</p>

        <p>If your site is older than 5 years, was custom-built without responsive design, or uses Flash (yes, we still find these in NH), a rebuild is usually more cost-effective than patching.</p>

        <p>The good news: modern website builders make mobile-friendly sites the default. A rebuild today will be mobile-first from day one. When choosing someone to do this work, use our guide on <a href="/blog/how-to-choose-seo-agency-nh.html">how to choose an SEO agency</a> — make sure mobile expertise is part of the conversation.</p>
