                <p class="lead">Google's E-E-A-T framework (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) directly impacts how your local business ranks. Quality raters at Google evaluate content using E-E-A-T, especially for YMYL (Your Money Your Life) topics. This guide shows you how to build each pillar and dominate local search.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="reveal">
                <h2>What Is E-E-A-T?</h2>
                <p>E-E-A-T is Google's quality framework for evaluating websites. In 2022, Google added "Experience" to the existing "Expertise, Authority, Trustworthiness" framework. Here's what each letter means:</p>
                <p><strong>Experience:</strong> Have you personally done this work? Do you have first-hand knowledge? A plumber writing about plumbing repairs should have installed pipes, fixed leaks, and worked with real customers. Experience is credibility earned through doing.</p>
                <p><strong>Expertise:</strong> Do you have specialized skill and knowledge? Expertise often means education, training, certifications, or years of focused study. A CPA writing about tax strategy has formal training. A neurosurgeon writing about brain procedures has advanced medical education. Expertise is credibility earned through study and qualification.</p>
                <p><strong>Authoritativeness:</strong> Is your site recognized as a leader in your field? Do other reputable sources cite you? Do industry associations recognize you? Authoritativeness comes from external validation—backlinks, media mentions, industry awards, and reputation in your community.</p>
                <p><strong>Trustworthiness:</strong> Can users trust your information? Is your site secure? Is your contact information visible? Do you disclose conflicts of interest? Trustworthiness is built through transparency, accuracy, and honest dealing with customers.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="reveal">
                <h2>Why E-E-A-T Matters for Local Businesses</h2>
                <p>Google's quality raters explicitly use E-E-A-T to score websites. Content that scores high on E-E-A-T ranks better. This matters especially for YMYL content—topics that affect a person's health, safety, finances, or legal rights. A dentist's site (health), a tax accountant's site (finances), and a real estate lawyer's site (legal) are all YMYL. Google holds these sites to a higher E-E-A-T standard.</p>
                <p>Local businesses have a natural advantage: you have real experience. You've served customers in your area. You have case studies, testimonials, and a physical location. But many local businesses don't showcase this E-E-A-T effectively. They hide credentials. They use stock photos instead of real client photos. They don't document their work. This guide helps you fix that.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="reveal">
                <h2>Experience: Show You've Done the Work</h2>
                <p>Experience is your competitive edge. You've worked with real clients. You've solved real problems. Show this:</p>
                <p><strong>Before/after photos and case studies.</strong> Nothing beats a before/after. A contractor showing a kitchen remodel from start to finish. A trainer showing client transformations. A painter showing room makeovers. Link your best case studies from your service pages and from your <a href="/case-studies.html">full case studies page</a>. Make case studies searchable and detailed.</p>
                <p><strong>Customer testimonials and video reviews.</strong> Video testimonials are gold. Real customers on camera saying how you helped them. This is authentic experience proof. Add video testimonials to your homepage and service pages.</p>
                <p><strong>Process documentation.</strong> Show your method. Write detailed how-to content that demonstrates your knowledge. A dentist writing "How We Prepare You for Root Canal Therapy" (not AI-generated, but from their actual practice). A HVAC company explaining their 7-point maintenance checklist. Document your process on your site to prove expertise through doing.</p>
                <p><strong>Years in business and team credentials.</strong> How long have you been doing this? If it's 15 years, say so. Add team member bios with real credentials. Include their certifications, education, specialties. A salon bio should list "10 years of hair experience, Schwarzkopf color certification, specializes in balayage." Specifics matter.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="reveal">
                <h2>Expertise: Demonstrate Knowledge</h2>
                <p>Expertise means you know your field deeply. Show this by creating educational content:</p>
                <p><strong>Blog content answering customer questions.</strong> Write detailed blog posts on topics customers ask about. A lawyer might write "What Happens During a Custody Evaluation?" or "What Should I Know About Property Division in NH?" These demonstrate legal knowledge. Link to these from your service pages. Your <a href="/blog/">blog is proof of expertise</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Detailed service pages.</strong> Don't write thin service descriptions. A 150-word page doesn't show expertise. Write 800+ word service pages that explain the process, the options, the pros and cons, the timeline, and the cost range. Link to detailed <a href="/services.html">service descriptions</a> from your homepage.</p>
                <p><strong>Industry certifications and licenses.</strong> Are you certified? Licensed? A plumber should display their license number. A therapist should list their credentials. An accountant should display their CPA status. These are expertise signals. Add them to your site footer, your bio pages, and your service pages.</p>
                <p><strong>FAQ pages answering real customer questions.</strong> Create FAQ schema markup with questions customers actually ask you. A chiropractor's FAQ might cover "Is chiropractic care safe?" or "How many visits will I need?" These answer questions and prove you understand customer concerns.</p>
                <p><strong>How-to guides and educational resources.</strong> Teach your customers something. A realtor might write "First-Time Home Buyer's Guide to New Hampshire." A dentist might write "The Complete Guide to Choosing Between Implants and Dentures." Educational content proves you know your field.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="reveal">
                <h2>Authoritativeness: Build Your Reputation</h2>
                <p>Authoritativeness means other people recognize you as a leader. Build it through:</p>
                <p><strong>Google reviews and ratings.</strong> <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">Google reviews are one of the strongest authority signals</a>. Ask customers to leave reviews after every job. Respond to all reviews (both positive and negative) promptly. 50 four-star reviews is a powerful authority signal. A high review volume shows that customers consistently rate you well.</p>
                <p><strong>Local citations and directory listings.</strong> Appearing in local directories (Yelp, BBB, industry directories) signals authority. <a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">Citations in consistent, authoritative directories build local authority</a>. Get listed in directories relevant to your industry.</p>
                <p><strong>Media mentions and press coverage.</strong> If you've been quoted in a newspaper or featured in a local publication, add this to your site. A screenshot of the article with a link back is an authority signal. Local press is especially valuable.</p>
                <p><strong>Industry associations and memberships.</strong> Are you a member of a professional association? The American Association of Retired Persons (for elder care)? The National Association of Realtors? Display these memberships. They're external validation of your authority.</p>
                <p><strong>Local business awards and recognition.</strong> If you've won an award ("Best Plumber 2024" or "Top 10 Tax Preparers"), display it. Awards are third-party recognition of your standing in your industry.</p>
                <p><strong>Backlinks from authoritative sites.</strong> Earn links from reputable sources. A mention in a neighborhood blog. A link from the local chamber of commerce. A reference from a complementary business. High-quality backlinks are authority signals.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="reveal">
                <h2>Trustworthiness: Earn Customer Confidence</h2>
                <p>Trustworthiness means customers feel safe doing business with you. Build it through:</p>
                <p><strong>HTTPS and SSL security.</strong> Your site must have an SSL certificate (HTTPS, not HTTP). This is basic trust infrastructure. No customer data should be unencrypted.</p>
                <p><strong>Clear contact information.</strong> Make it easy to reach you. Phone number, email, physical address. All visible. No hiding behind contact forms. Legitimate businesses are easy to contact.</p>
                <p><strong>Privacy policy and transparency.</strong> Have a clear <a href="/privacy.html">privacy policy</a>. Explain how you use customer data. If you collect emails or payment info, say so. Say who you are. Privacy policies build trust.</p>
                <p><strong>Transparent pricing.</strong> List your prices or give a clear process for getting quotes. Vague pricing feels untrustworthy. "Starts at $X" or "Average cost is $X" gives customers confidence they understand what they're getting.</p>
                <p><strong>Accurate NAP information.</strong> NAP = Name, Address, Phone. Your business name, address, and phone should be consistent everywhere: your site, Google Business Profile, social media, directories. Inconsistencies hurt trust and local rankings.</p>
                <p><strong>Responding to customer reviews.</strong> Respond to all Google reviews—positive and negative. Negative reviews need a thoughtful, professional response. This shows you care about customer satisfaction and are responsive. It builds trust.</p>
                <p><strong>Real photos, not stock images.</strong> Use photos of your actual business, your team, your work. Real photos are more trustworthy than stock photos. A dentist's site should show the actual office and dentists, not generic stock photos. Real images build credibility.</p>

                <h2>Common E-E-A-T Mistakes</h2>
                <p>Avoid these E-E-A-T killers:</p>
                <p><strong>Using stock photos.</strong> "Diverse business team looking at charts" on Getty Images tells customers you're generic, not specialized. Use real photos of your actual business, team, and work.</p>
                <p><strong>No author bios or credentials.</strong> If your blog has no author information, it signals low expertise. Add author bios with qualifications. If you're a CPA writing about taxes, say so. If you're a licensed contractor, say so.</p>
                <p><strong>Thin, AI-generated content.</strong> "We are a local business offering services" tells customers you have no real knowledge. Write specific, detailed content that shows you actually know your field. <a href="/blog/ai-seo-local-business-2026.html">Use AI to accelerate, not replace, your expertise</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Fake reviews or paying for reviews.</strong> Google detects patterns of fake reviews. They get deleted. Worse, they hurt your authority if discovered. Only real customer reviews count.</p>
                <p><strong>Hidden contact information.</strong> If someone has to dig to find your phone number, you look untrustworthy. Phone numbers go in the header, footer, and contact page. Make it easy.</p>
                <p><strong>Inconsistent business information.</strong> Your name, address, and phone on your website should match Google Business Profile, Yelp, and directories exactly. Mismatches confuse search engines and customers.</p>
                <p><strong>No response to negative reviews.</strong> If a customer leaves a bad review and you ignore it, it signals you don't care. A thoughtful response to criticism builds trust.</p>
                <p><strong>Credentials not displayed.</strong> Have a license? A certification? A degree? Customers don't know unless you tell them. Display credentials prominently.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>E-E-A-T is Google's quality framework, and it directly impacts your local rankings. You have a natural advantage: real experience, real expertise, real relationships in your community. But you must showcase it.</p>
                <p>Start with the checklist above. Pick the 3–5 items you're missing and tackle them first. Document your experience with case studies and photos. Write detailed content that proves your expertise. Build your authority through reviews, citations, and media coverage. Establish trustworthiness through transparency and responsive customer service.</p>
                <p>Businesses that build strong E-E-A-T signals rank higher, get more customer inquiries, and grow faster. The businesses that ignore E-E-A-T get left behind.</p>
