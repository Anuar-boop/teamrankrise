            <p class="intro-text">Your Google Business Profile category is the single most important factor in determining whether you appear in the <a href="/blog/google-local-pack-ranking.html">Local Pack</a>. Choose the wrong category, and you're invisible for your most valuable searches. Choose the right one, and you've given yourself the biggest possible head start.</p>

            <p>This guide shows you exactly how to select your primary category, which secondary categories to add, and common mistakes that cost businesses thousands in lost visibility.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Why Categories Matter So Much</h2>

            <p>Google uses your primary category as the main signal for which searches to show your business. When someone searches "plumber near me," Google first filters by businesses with "Plumber" as their category — then ranks them by other factors like reviews, distance, and website quality.</p>

            <p><strong>If your category is wrong, you don't even enter the competition.</strong> A plumber categorized as "Home Improvement Store" will never appear for "plumber" searches, regardless of how many reviews or how great their website is.</p>

            <p>Research consistently shows GBP categories are the #1 factor for Local Pack rankings, accounting for roughly <strong>32% of total ranking signals</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Primary vs. Secondary Categories</h2>

            <h3>Primary Category</h3>
            <p>Your primary category is the most important. It:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Determines which searches trigger your listing</li>
                <li>Appears directly on your GBP listing</li>
                <li>Has the strongest ranking impact</li>
                <li>Should be the most specific, accurate description of your core business</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Secondary Categories</h3>
            <p>You can add up to 9 secondary categories. They:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Help you appear for additional search types</li>
                <li>Are NOT visible on your public listing</li>
                <li>Have less ranking weight than primary (roughly 25-50% of primary's impact)</li>
                <li>Should cover legitimate additional services you offer</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Rule of Thumb</h3>
            <p><strong>Primary:</strong> What you are. <strong>Secondary:</strong> What else you do.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>How to Choose Your Primary Category</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Search for Your Main Service</h3>
            <p>Google "[your service] [your city]" in an incognito window. Look at the Local Pack results. What categories do the top 3 businesses use? (Click on each listing and check their category under the business name.)</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Be as Specific as Possible</h3>
            <p>Google has over 4,000 categories. The more specific you can be, the better:</p>

            <div class="table-wrapper">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Too Broad</th>
                            <th>Better</th>
                            <th>Best</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>Construction Company</td><td>Roofing Contractor</td><td>Roofing Contractor (if that's your focus)</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Doctor</td><td>Dentist</td><td>Cosmetic Dentist (if that's your specialty)</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Restaurant</td><td>Italian Restaurant</td><td>Italian Restaurant</td></tr>

                </table>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Match the Customer Search</h3>
            <p>Think about what your ideal customer searches for. If most people search "emergency plumber," and Google has "Emergency Plumbing Service" as a category, use it — even if "Plumber" is the broader option.</p>

            <h2>How Many Secondary Categories to Add</h2>

            <p>You can add up to 9, but <strong>more isn't always better</strong>. Here's the guideline:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>3-5 categories:</strong> Ideal for most businesses. Covers your core services without dilution.</li>
                <li><strong>6-9 categories:</strong> Only if you genuinely offer that many distinct services. A plumber who also does HVAC and electrical legitimately needs more categories.</li>
                <li><strong>1-2 categories:</strong> Too few. You're missing opportunities to appear for related searches.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Quality Test</h3>
            <p>For each secondary category, ask: "If a customer searched for this, would I be a legitimate result?" If yes, add it. If it's a stretch, skip it.</p>

            <p>Adding irrelevant categories can actually hurt your rankings — Google may see your listing as spammy or untrustworthy. A dentist adding "Car Dealer" as a category isn't fooling anyone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>How to Find Available Categories</h2>

            <p>Google doesn't publish a complete list. Here's how to discover what's available:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Log into your GBP dashboard</li>
                <li>Click "Edit profile" → "Business category"</li>
                <li>Start typing a keyword and see what Google suggests</li>
                <li>Try different word variations (e.g., "plumber" vs "plumbing" vs "pipe")</li>
                <li>Look at what competitors use (visible on their listings)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Category Discovery Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Try singular and plural ("Dentist" vs "Dentists")</li>
                <li>Try different word orders ("Cleaning Service" vs "Service Cleaning")</li>
                <li>Try industry jargon vs consumer language ("HVAC Contractor" vs "AC Repair")</li>
                <li>New categories are added regularly — check back every few months</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>When to Change Your Category</h2>

            <p>Consider changing your primary category if:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You're not appearing in the Local Pack for your main search terms</li>
                <li>You've pivoted your business focus (e.g., from general contracting to roofing)</li>
                <li>A more specific category has been added by Google</li>
                <li>Your top competitors use a different, more specific category</li>
                <li>You're ranking for the wrong searches (attracting the wrong customers)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How Category Changes Work</h3>
            <p>Changing your primary category can cause a temporary ranking fluctuation (1-2 weeks). Google needs to re-evaluate your listing for the new category. Don't panic if rankings drop briefly — they typically recover and improve if the new category is more accurate.</p>

            <p><strong>Never change your category during peak season.</strong> If you're an HVAC company, don't experiment in July. Change in a slow month (for NH, that varies by industry — follow the <a href="/blog/nh-seasonal-marketing-calendar.html">seasonal calendar</a>).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Category Mistakes That Kill Rankings</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Too broad</strong> — "Construction Company" when you're specifically a roofer. You'll compete against every construction business instead of just roofers.</li>
                <li><strong>Too niche</strong> — If the niche category has very low search volume, a broader category might perform better. Check search volume before going ultra-specific.</li>
                <li><strong>Wrong focus</strong> — A dental practice that does mostly general dentistry choosing "Cosmetic Dentist" as primary. Match your primary to your primary revenue source.</li>
                <li><strong>Irrelevant secondaries</strong> — Adding categories for services you don't actually offer. This confuses Google and can trigger a manual review.</li>
                <li><strong>Competitor-matching blindly</strong> — Just because a competitor uses a category doesn't mean it's right for you. They might be wrong too.</li>
                <li><strong>Never reviewing</strong> — Google adds new categories regularly. A category that didn't exist last year might be perfect for you now.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Categories and Your Website</h2>

            <p>Your GBP categories and website content should align. If your primary category is "Emergency Plumbing Service," your website should have:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A dedicated emergency plumbing page</li>
                <li>"Emergency plumbing" mentioned in your homepage title and content</li>
                <li><a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">Schema markup</a> matching the same business type</li>
                <li>Content about emergency plumbing scenarios, response times, services</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When GBP categories and website content align, Google has consistent signals and ranks you with more confidence. Mismatches create confusion and weaker rankings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Category Audit Checklist</h2>

            <p>Run through this quarterly:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Is your primary category the most specific accurate option?</li>
                <li>Do competitors use a category you're missing?</li>
                <li>Are all secondary categories for services you actively offer?</li>
                <li>Does your website content align with your categories?</li>
                <li>Has Google added any new categories relevant to you?</li>
                <li>Are you appearing in the <a href="/blog/google-local-pack-ranking.html">Local Pack</a> for your target searches?</li>
                <li>Is your <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-description.html">GBP description</a> consistent with your categories?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Your GBP category is the foundation of your local search visibility. Get it right, and everything else — reviews, content, links — builds on a solid base. Get it wrong, and none of those other efforts matter because you're competing in the wrong race.</p>

            <p>Take 15 minutes right now: check your primary category, see what your top competitors use, and make sure you haven't left easy secondary categories on the table. It's the highest-ROI 15 minutes you'll spend on SEO this month.</p>
