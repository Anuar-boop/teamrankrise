            <p class="lead">You&rsquo;re paying for SEO. Your agency sends monthly reports full of charts and numbers. But you still can&rsquo;t answer the most basic question: <strong>is it actually working?</strong></p>

            <p>You&rsquo;re not alone. Most NH business owners we talk to say the same thing: they don&rsquo;t know what to look at, what the numbers mean, or what &ldquo;good&rdquo; looks like.</p>

            <p>This guide fixes that. We&rsquo;ll show you the 7 metrics that actually matter, the free tools to track them, and what realistic progress looks like at 3, 6, and 12 months.</p>

            <h2>Why Most SEO Reports Are Useless</h2>

            <p>Here&rsquo;s the problem with typical agency reports:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Too much data, too little insight</strong> &mdash; 30 pages of charts that don&rsquo;t answer &ldquo;am I getting more customers?&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Vanity metrics</strong> &mdash; they highlight &ldquo;impressions&rdquo; and &ldquo;domain authority&rdquo; instead of actual leads</li>
                <li><strong>No benchmarks</strong> &mdash; they show numbers but never say whether those numbers are good or bad</li>
                <li><strong>Jargon overload</strong> &mdash; CTR, SERP, DA, DR, backlinks&hellip; it feels designed to confuse</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A good report should answer three questions in 30 seconds: Am I getting more visibility? Am I getting more traffic? Am I getting more customers?</p>

            <h2>The 7 Metrics That Actually Matter</h2>

            <h3>1. Google Business Profile Views</h3>

            <p>This is the single most important metric for local businesses. Your <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-tips.html">Google Business Profile</a> shows up in Maps, the local pack, and &ldquo;near me&rdquo; searches.</p>

            <p><strong>Where to find it:</strong> Go to your Google Business Profile dashboard &rarr; Performance. Look at &ldquo;Business Profile interactions&rdquo; &mdash; that includes calls, direction requests, and website clicks.</p>

            <p><strong>What good looks like:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Month 1-3: 10-30% increase in profile views</li>
                <li>Month 3-6: 30-80% increase over your starting point</li>
                <li>Month 6-12: 2-4x your starting numbers</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> If GBP views are flat after 3 months of SEO work, something is wrong.</p>

            <h3>2. Organic Website Traffic</h3>

            <p>This is how many people find your website through Google (not ads, not social media, not direct). It&rsquo;s the clearest signal that your <a href="/blog/website-seo-checklist.html">website optimization</a> is working.</p>

            <p><strong>Where to find it:</strong> Google Analytics 4 &rarr; Reports &rarr; Acquisition &rarr; Traffic acquisition. Filter to &ldquo;Organic Search.&rdquo;</p>

            <p><strong>What good looks like for local local businesses:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Starting point: 50-200 organic visits/month (typical for an unoptimized small business site)</li>
                <li>After 6 months of SEO: 300-800 organic visits/month</li>
                <li>After 12 months: 800-2,000+ organic visits/month</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Don&rsquo;t panic about day-to-day fluctuations. Look at the month-over-month trend. <a href="/blog/how-long-seo-takes.html">SEO takes time</a> &mdash; expect a slow ramp for the first 2-3 months.</p>

            <h3>3. Keyword Rankings</h3>

            <p>Where you show up when people search for your services. This is the metric most people think of when they think &ldquo;SEO.&rdquo;</p>

            <p><strong>Where to find it:</strong> Google Search Console &rarr; Performance &rarr; Queries. This shows every search term where your site appeared in results, plus your average position.</p>

            <p><strong>What to track:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Money keywords:</strong> &ldquo;[your service] + [your city]&rdquo; (e.g., &ldquo;plumber Manchester NH&rdquo;)</li>
                <li><strong>Near-me keywords:</strong> &ldquo;[your service] near me&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Question keywords:</strong> &ldquo;how much does [service] cost in NH&rdquo;</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What good looks like:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Position 50+ &rarr; you&rsquo;re essentially invisible</li>
                <li>Position 10-20 &rarr; page 2 (almost nobody clicks here)</li>
                <li>Position 4-10 &rarr; bottom of page 1 (some clicks)</li>
                <li>Position 1-3 &rarr; the sweet spot (65%+ of all clicks)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Watch for keywords moving from page 2+ into the top 10. That&rsquo;s the transition that creates real traffic. For local rankings, check our <a href="/blog/google-maps-ranking-nh.html">Google Maps ranking guide</a>.</p>

            <h3>4. Phone Calls and Form Submissions</h3>

            <p>Traffic means nothing if it doesn&rsquo;t turn into customers. Track every lead that comes from your website.</p>

            <p><strong>Where to find it:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phone calls:</strong> Google Business Profile tracks &ldquo;calls&rdquo; automatically. For website calls, set up Google Analytics event tracking on your click-to-call link.</li>
                <li><strong>Form submissions:</strong> Track form completions in GA4 as conversions, or simply count emails from your contact form.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What good looks like:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conversion rate of 3-8% from organic traffic (meaning 3-8 out of 100 organic visitors contact you)</li>
                <li>For a local service business getting 500 organic visits/month: 15-40 leads/month from organic</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If traffic is growing but leads aren&rsquo;t, your website has a <a href="/blog/website-losing-customers.html">conversion problem</a>, not an SEO problem.</p>

            <h3>5. Local Pack Appearances</h3>

            <p>The &ldquo;local pack&rdquo; (or &ldquo;map pack&rdquo;) is the 3-business box with a map that appears at the top of local searches. Being in this box is worth more than the #1 organic result for most local businesses.</p>

            <p><strong>Where to find it:</strong> Google Search Console shows impressions from &ldquo;Maps&rdquo; results separately. You can also manually search your key terms and see if you appear.</p>

            <p><strong>What good looks like:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Appearing in the map pack for 5-10 of your target keywords within 6 months</li>
                <li>Appearing for 15-25+ keywords within 12 months</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The three biggest factors for map pack rankings: <a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">NAP consistency</a>, <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">Google reviews</a>, and proximity to the searcher. You can control the first two.</p>

            <h3>6. Review Count and Rating</h3>

            <p><a href="/blog/online-reviews-local-seo.html">Reviews directly impact your rankings</a> and your conversion rate. Track them as an SEO metric, not just a reputation metric.</p>

            <p><strong>Where to find it:</strong> Your Google Business Profile shows your total review count and average rating. Check it monthly.</p>

            <p><strong>What good looks like:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimum: 20+ reviews with 4.2+ stars to be competitive in NH</li>
                <li>Good: 50+ reviews with 4.5+ stars</li>
                <li>Great: 100+ reviews with 4.7+ stars</li>
                <li>Monthly velocity: 2-4 new reviews/month for a small business</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7. Backlink Growth</h3>

            <p>Backlinks (other websites linking to yours) are one of Google&rsquo;s top ranking factors. You should see steady growth if your SEO agency is doing its job.</p>

            <p><strong>Where to find it:</strong> Google Search Console &rarr; Links &rarr; External links. For more detail, free tools like Ahrefs Webmaster Tools or Moz&rsquo;s Link Explorer show your backlink profile.</p>

            <p><strong>What good looks like for a NH local business:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Starting point: 5-20 referring domains</li>
                <li>After 6 months: 30-60 referring domains</li>
                <li>After 12 months: 60-120 referring domains</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Quality matters more than quantity. One link from NH Business Review or your local Chamber of Commerce is worth more than 50 links from random directories. See our <a href="/blog/backlinks-local-seo-nh.html">backlink building guide</a> for strategies.</p>

            <h2>Free Tools You Need (and Nothing Else)</h2>

            <h2>Your Monthly SEO Check-In (15 Minutes)</h2>

            <p>You don&rsquo;t need to check dashboards every day. Once a month, spend 15 minutes on this:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Google Business Profile (3 min):</strong> Check profile views vs. last month. Note review count and rating. Respond to any new reviews.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Search Console (5 min):</strong> Check total clicks and impressions for the last 28 days vs. previous 28 days. Look at your top 10 keywords &mdash; are positions improving?</li>
                <li><strong>Google Analytics (5 min):</strong> Check organic traffic vs. last month. Look at your top landing pages. Note any form submissions or call conversions.</li>
                <li><strong>Quick gut check (2 min):</strong> Are you getting more calls and emails from new customers than you were 3 months ago? That&rsquo;s the ultimate test.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>What Realistic Progress Looks Like</h2>

            <p>Here&rsquo;s what we typically see for local businesses that invest in <a href="/blog/local-seo-guide-nh.html">proper local SEO</a>:</p>

            <h3>Month 1-2: Foundation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Technical issues fixed, <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">schema markup</a> added</li>
                <li>GBP fully optimized</li>
                <li>Rankings may actually dip slightly (normal after big changes)</li>
                <li>Organic traffic: flat or small increase</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Month 3-4: Early Signals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Keywords start moving from page 3-4 to page 2</li>
                <li>Organic traffic up 15-30%</li>
                <li>GBP views increasing</li>
                <li>First map pack appearances for less competitive terms</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Month 5-6: Momentum</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Several keywords hit page 1</li>
                <li>Organic traffic up 40-80%</li>
                <li>Noticeable increase in calls and form submissions</li>
                <li>Map pack appearances for 5-10 target keywords</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Month 7-12: Results Compound</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple page 1 rankings for money keywords</li>
                <li>Organic traffic 2-4x starting point</li>
                <li>Steady lead flow from organic search</li>
                <li>Reduced dependence on paid ads</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This timeline assumes consistent monthly effort. Stop and start, and you&rsquo;ll push everything back. <a href="/blog/how-long-seo-takes.html">Here&rsquo;s our full breakdown of SEO timelines</a>.</p>

            <h2>Red Flags: When to Question Your SEO Agency</h2>

            <p>If any of these are happening, it&rsquo;s time for a serious conversation with whoever is doing your SEO:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>No movement after 4 months</strong> &mdash; some patience is needed, but zero improvement after 4 months of work means something is wrong</li>
                <li><strong>They can&rsquo;t show you Search Console data</strong> &mdash; if they don&rsquo;t have access or won&rsquo;t share it, that&rsquo;s a red flag</li>
                <li><strong>Traffic up but leads flat</strong> &mdash; they might be ranking for the wrong keywords or attracting irrelevant traffic</li>
                <li><strong>They guarantee specific rankings</strong> &mdash; no one can guarantee a #1 spot. Google&rsquo;s algorithm considers 200+ factors. <a href="/blog/how-to-choose-seo-agency-nh.html">Here&rsquo;s how to evaluate an SEO agency properly</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Reports are just screenshots</strong> &mdash; a real report explains what was done, what changed, and what&rsquo;s next</li>
                <li><strong>They won&rsquo;t give you account access</strong> &mdash; you should own your Google Analytics, Search Console, and GBP accounts. Always.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common <a href="/blog/diy-seo-mistakes.html">DIY Mistakes</a> When Tracking SEO</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Checking rankings daily.</strong> Rankings fluctuate. Daily checks create anxiety over normal variation. Monthly is enough.</li>
                <li><strong>Confusing paid and organic traffic.</strong> Make sure you&rsquo;re looking at organic traffic only, not total traffic (which includes ads).</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring mobile separately.</strong> Most local searches happen on <a href="/blog/mobile-friendly-website-nh.html">mobile devices</a>. Check your mobile traffic and rankings specifically.</li>
                <li><strong>Focusing on vanity metrics.</strong> Domain authority, total impressions, and number of indexed pages are interesting but don&rsquo;t directly measure business results.</li>
                <li><strong>Not tracking before you start.</strong> Take a baseline snapshot before any SEO work begins so you can measure actual improvement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Only Question That Matters</h2>

            <p>After all the metrics, tools, and benchmarks, SEO success comes down to one question:</p>

            <p><strong>Are you getting more customers from Google than you were 6 months ago?</strong></p>

            <p>If yes, your SEO is working. If no, it&rsquo;s time to figure out why &mdash; and the metrics above will tell you exactly where the problem is.</p>

            <p>Most local businesses we work with see meaningful results within 4-6 months. The key is having the right strategy, executing consistently, and actually tracking progress so you know what&rsquo;s working.</p>
