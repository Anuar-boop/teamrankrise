        <p class="lead">Every one of these mistakes is actively sending potential customers to your competitors. We see them on virtually every new client audit we perform. The frustrating part? Most are fixable in a single afternoon. Here are the 12 most expensive local SEO mistakes — and exactly how to fix each one.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 1: Incomplete Google Business Profile</h2>

        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 70% fewer customer actions compared to complete profiles</p>

        <p>An incomplete GBP is the #1 most common and most expensive local SEO mistake. We regularly see profiles missing descriptions, services, photos, hours, or attributes.</p>

        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Complete every single field in your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a>. Write a keyword-rich <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-description.html">description</a>. Add all services with descriptions. Upload 20+ photos. Set accurate hours including holidays. Follow our <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-tips.html">full optimization guide</a>.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 2: No Review Strategy</h2>

        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3-5x fewer Map Pack clicks than reviewed competitors</p>

        <p>Hoping customers will leave reviews on their own doesn't work. Businesses with a system get 10-20x more reviews than those without one.</p>

        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Build a simple review generation process. Ask every happy customer within 24 hours of service completion. Make it one-click easy with a direct review link. See our <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">review strategy</a> and <a href="/blog/first-50-google-reviews.html">first 50 reviews guide</a>.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 3: Inconsistent NAP Information</h2>

        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Google confusion about your location = lower local rankings across the board</p>

        <p>Your business name, address, and phone number appear differently across the internet — "Suite 100" on Google, "Ste 100" on Yelp, different phone on Facebook. Google loses confidence in your information.</p>

        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Audit every citation and directory listing. Make your <a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">NAP identical everywhere</a>. Even small differences matter. Set a "canonical" version and update everything to match.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 4: Wrong GBP Category</h2>

        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Missing entire categories of searches you should rank for</p>

        <p>Choosing "Home Services" when you should choose "Plumber" means Google doesn't know to show you for plumbing searches. Your primary category is one of the most important ranking signals.</p>

        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Research the most specific category that describes your primary business. Add secondary categories for additional services (up to 10). Check what categories top-ranking competitors use.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 5: No Service Pages</h2>

        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Missing rankings for every individual service you offer</p>

        <p>A single "Services" page listing everything with one sentence each can't rank for individual service keywords. You're essentially invisible for specific searches like "water heater installation Nashua NH."</p>

        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Create a <a href="/blog/service-pages-that-rank-convert.html">dedicated page for each major service</a> with 500+ words of unique content, FAQ, pricing guidance, and a call-to-action. One service per page.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 6: Ignoring Mobile Users</h2>

        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Losing 70%+ of your potential visitors before they even see your content</p>

        <p>Over 70% of local searches happen on mobile. If your site is slow, hard to navigate, or has tiny text on phones, those visitors bounce — and Google notices.</p>

        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Test your site on a phone right now. Is the phone number clickable? Can you read everything without zooming? Does it load in under 3 seconds? Our <a href="/blog/mobile-friendly-website-nh.html">mobile guide</a> and <a href="/blog/website-speed-optimization.html">speed guide</a> cover every fix.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 7: No Local Content</h2>

        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Zero topical authority = zero long-tail traffic = zero educational leads</p>

        <p>A website with only service pages and a contact page leaves massive amounts of local search traffic on the table. People search for advice, comparisons, and information long before they're ready to buy.</p>

        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Start a blog and publish content that answers your customers' most common questions. Even one post per month makes a difference. Use our <a href="/blog/local-seo-content-calendar.html">content calendar</a> and <a href="/blog/keyword-research-local-seo.html">keyword research</a> guides to plan strategically.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 8: Not Tracking Anything</h2>

        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Spending money (or time) on SEO without knowing what's working</p>

        <p>Shocking how many businesses have no analytics installed. You can't improve what you don't measure.</p>

        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Install <a href="/blog/google-analytics-local-business.html">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="/blog/google-search-console-local-seo.html">Google Search Console</a> (both free). Check them monthly. Our <a href="/blog/track-seo-results.html">tracking guide</a> shows exactly what to monitor.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 9: Targeting Impossible Keywords</h2>

        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Months of effort ranking for terms you'll never win</p>

        <p>Trying to rank for "plumber" nationally or "best restaurant" when you're a small local business is wasted effort. You're competing against massive sites with decades of authority.</p>

        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Target location-specific, long-tail keywords: "emergency plumber Manchester NH," "Italian restaurant downtown Portsmouth NH." These are achievable and have high purchase intent. Use <a href="/blog/keyword-research-local-seo.html">keyword research</a> to find your sweet spots.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 10: No Internal Linking</h2>

        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Orphan pages that never rank + missed conversion opportunities</p>

        <p>Pages that don't link to other pages on your site are harder for Google to find and rank. You're also missing chances to guide visitors from informational content to conversion pages.</p>

        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Every page should link to 3-5 other relevant pages. Blog posts should link to service pages. Service pages should link to related posts. Our <a href="/blog/internal-linking-seo.html">internal linking guide</a> has the complete strategy.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 11: Ignoring Negative Reviews</h2>

        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 94% of consumers say a negative review has convinced them to avoid a business</p>

        <p>Negative reviews happen to every business. Ignoring them is worse than the review itself — it tells potential customers you don't care.</p>

        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Respond to every negative review professionally within 24-48 hours. Acknowledge the issue, apologize where appropriate, and offer to resolve it offline. Our <a href="/blog/handle-negative-reviews.html">negative review guide</a> and <a href="/blog/respond-to-google-reviews.html">response templates</a> show exactly how.</p>

        <h2>Mistake 12: No Schema Markup</h2>

        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Missing rich results, reduced click-through rates, weaker local signals</p>

        <p><a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">Schema markup</a> tells Google exactly what your business is, where it is, and what you offer — in a structured format it can easily understand. Without it, Google has to guess.</p>

        <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Add LocalBusiness schema to every page with your business name, address, phone, hours, and services. Our schema guide provides copy-paste code templates.</p>

        <h2>How Many Are You Making?</h2>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Mistakes Found</th>
                    <th>Estimated Monthly Revenue Loss</th>

                    <td>Fix within 30 days</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>6-8</td>
                    <td>$2,000-$5,000/month in missed leads</td>
                    <td>Urgent — fix this week</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>9-12</td>
                    <td>$5,000+/month — competitors own your market</td>
                    <td>Emergency — get professional help</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>These aren't exaggerations. A plumber in Manchester NH making all 12 mistakes is invisible to the 1,900+ monthly searches for plumbing services in their area. At $200-500 average job value and 2-3% conversion rate, that's significant revenue.</p>
