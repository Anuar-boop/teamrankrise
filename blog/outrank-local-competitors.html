            <p class="intro-text">You search for your service in your town. Your competitors show up. You don't. It's frustrating — especially when you know your business is better. The good news: local search rankings aren't permanent. With the right strategy, you can systematically overtake the businesses currently sitting in those top spots.</p>

            <p>This isn't about tricks or shortcuts. It's about understanding exactly what your competitors are doing, finding the gaps in their strategy, and executing better and more consistently than they do.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Step 1: Know Who You're Actually Competing Against</h2>

            <p>Your local search competitors aren't always who you think. Do this search right now:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Open an incognito/private browser window</li>
                <li>Search for your main service + your town (e.g., "plumber Manchester NH")</li>
                <li>Write down the top 3 businesses in the <a href="/blog/google-local-pack-ranking.html">Local Pack</a></li>
                <li>Write down the top 5 websites in organic results</li>
                <li>Repeat for 3-5 of your most important keyword variations</li>
            </ol>

            <p>You should see patterns — the same 3-5 businesses keep appearing. <strong>These are your real competitors</strong>, not necessarily the businesses you think of as competitors in the real world.</p>

            <h3>The Competitor Scorecard</h3>
            <p>For each competitor, record:</p>

            <div class="table-wrapper">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Factor</th>
                            <th>How to Check</th>
                            <th>You</th>
                            <th>Competitor</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>Google review count</td><td>Search their business name</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Google star rating</td><td>Search their business name</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Number of website pages</td><td>Search: site:theirdomain.com</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Blog posts</td><td>Check their blog/news section</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>GBP photos</td><td>Check their Google listing</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>GBP posts (recent)</td><td>Check "Updates" on their listing</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Mobile-friendly</td><td>Visit their site on your phone</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Page speed</td><td>PageSpeed Insights</td><td>___</td><td>___</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p>This scorecard shows you exactly where you're ahead and where you're behind. You don't need to win every category — just win the ones that matter most. Read our full <a href="/blog/competitor-seo-analysis.html">competitor SEO analysis guide</a> for deeper research techniques.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Step 2: Win the Google Business Profile Battle</h2>

            <p>The <a href="/blog/google-local-pack-ranking.html">Local Pack</a> is where most local searches convert. GBP signals account for ~32% of ranking factors. Here's how to beat competitors here:</p>

            <h3>Category Optimization</h3>
            <p>Check what categories your competitors use (visible in their listing). Make sure your primary category is more specific than theirs. "Emergency Plumber" beats "Plumber" if you do emergency work. "Cosmetic Dentist" beats "Dentist" for cosmetic searches.</p>

            <h3>Review Volume Gap</h3>
            <p>If your top competitor has 150 reviews and you have 30, that's your biggest gap. Close it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Calculate the gap: 150 - 30 = 120 reviews behind</li>
                <li>Set monthly targets: 10-15 new reviews per month</li>
                <li>At 15/month, you'll match them in 8 months — and they're probably not growing as fast</li>
                <li>Follow our <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">review generation playbook</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Photo and Post Activity</h3>
            <p>Most competitors post sporadically or not at all. Weekly <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-posts.html">GBP posts</a> and regular photo uploads signal to Google that you're an active, legitimate business. If your competitor hasn't posted in 3 months, you win this factor easily.</p>

            <h3>Complete Every Field</h3>
            <p>Write a full <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-description.html">750-character description</a>, list all services, add attributes, set special hours. Most businesses leave 40-60% of their GBP incomplete. Being 100% complete is an easy win.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Step 3: Build a Better Website</h2>

            <p>Your website is the foundation of organic rankings. Here's how to outperform competitors:</p>

            <h3>Content Depth</h3>
            <p>Count your competitor's pages (search "site:theirdomain.com"). If they have 10 pages and you have 5, create more. But don't just add pages — add <strong>better</strong> pages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="/blog/service-pages-that-rank-convert.html">Dedicated service pages</a> for every service (not a list of all services on one page)</li>
                <li><a href="/blog/local-seo-for-multiple-locations.html">Location pages</a> for every town you serve</li>
                <li><a href="/blog/seo-friendly-content-writing.html">Blog content</a> targeting questions your customers ask</li>
                <li>FAQ pages addressing common objections</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>On-Page SEO</h3>
            <p>Check if competitors are doing basic on-page SEO. Look at their page titles (visible in the browser tab). If they say "Home" or just their business name, they're not optimized. You can easily outrank them by:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Writing keyword-optimized title tags: "[Service] in [Town], NH | [Business Name]"</li>
                <li>Adding <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">schema markup</a> (most competitors don't have this)</li>
                <li>Building a strong <a href="/blog/internal-linking-seo.html">internal linking structure</a></li>
                <li>Optimizing for <a href="/blog/keyword-research-local-seo.html">the right keywords</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Page Speed</h3>
            <p>Test your site and competitors' sites at PageSpeed Insights. If they score 40 and you score 85, that's a ranking advantage. <a href="/blog/website-speed-optimization.html">Speed optimization</a> is often the easiest technical win because most small business websites are slow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Step 4: Out-Content Your Competition</h2>

            <p>Content is the long-term competitive moat. Here's the strategy:</p>

            <h3>Find Their Content Gaps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Look at their blog or content section</li>
                <li>Search for keywords they're ranking for (use <a href="/blog/google-search-console-local-seo.html">free tools</a>)</li>
                <li>Identify topics they haven't covered</li>
                <li>Write better content on those topics first</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The 10x Content Strategy</h3>
            <p>When a competitor has content on a topic, don't just match it — make yours 10x better:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>If they wrote 500 words, write 1,500 with more detail and examples</li>
                <li>If they have no visuals, add tables, checklists, and diagrams</li>
                <li>If their content is generic, make yours specific to NH</li>
                <li>If their content is outdated (2023 data), use current 2026 information</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Consistency Wins</h3>
            <p>Most small businesses publish a few blog posts and stop. Use a <a href="/blog/local-seo-content-calendar.html">content calendar</a> to publish consistently — even one post every 2 weeks puts you ahead of 90% of local competitors. Over a year, that's 26 pieces of content targeting 26 different keyword clusters.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Step 5: Build a Stronger Link Profile</h2>

            <p>Backlinks remain a significant ranking factor. Most local businesses have very few links, so even small efforts make a big difference.</p>

            <h3>Check Competitors' Backlinks</h3>
            <p>Use free tools (Ahrefs free backlink checker, Moz Link Explorer) to see who links to your competitors. Common sources:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Chamber of Commerce memberships</li>
                <li>Local business directories</li>
                <li>News articles or press coverage</li>
                <li>Sponsor mentions on event websites</li>
                <li>Partner business websites</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Get the Same Links — Plus More</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Match their directory listings</strong> — <a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">get listed everywhere they are</a></li>
                <li><strong>Join what they've joined</strong> — same Chamber, same associations</li>
                <li><strong>Sponsor what they sponsor</strong> — plus find new local events</li>
                <li><strong>Create linkable content</strong> — guides, tools, or resources people want to reference</li>
                <li><strong>Build relationships</strong> — <a href="/blog/get-local-backlinks-nh.html">local partnerships that include links</a></li>
            </ol>

            <p>You don't need hundreds of links. In local SEO, <strong>20-30 quality local links can be enough to overtake competitors</strong> who rely on the same 5-10 directory listings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Step 6: Win the Review Game</h2>

            <p>Reviews impact both rankings and conversion. A business with more reviews AND a higher rating will almost always win.</p>

            <h3>The Review Competitive Analysis</h3>

            <div class="table-wrapper">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Competitor</th>
                            <th>Reviews</th>
                            <th>Rating</th>
                            <th>Monthly New</th>
                            <th>Response Rate</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>Competitor A</td><td>185</td><td>4.6</td><td>~5</td><td>30%</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Competitor B</td><td>92</td><td>4.8</td><td>~3</td><td>0%</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Competitor C</td><td>67</td><td>4.3</td><td>~2</td><td>50%</td></tr>
                        <tr><td><strong>You</strong></td><td><strong>35</strong></td><td><strong>4.9</strong></td><td><strong>?</strong></td><td><strong>100%</strong></td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p>In this example, you have the best rating and response rate, but the lowest volume. Your strategy: maintain your quality while aggressively increasing volume. At 10+ new reviews per month, you'll overtake Competitor C in 4 months and Competitor B in 6 months.</p>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Step 7: Target Their Weak Keywords</h2>

            <p>Every competitor has keywords they're not targeting. Find and claim them:</p>

            <h3>Keyword Gap Analysis</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Long-tail keywords</strong> — If they rank for "plumber Manchester NH," target "emergency plumber Manchester NH," "affordable plumber Manchester NH," "24 hour plumber Manchester NH"</li>
                <li><strong>Service variations</strong> — If they have a page for "AC repair," create pages for "AC repair," "AC installation," "AC maintenance," "ductless mini-split installation"</li>
                <li><strong>Location variations</strong> — If they target Manchester, also target surrounding towns they miss (Bedford, Goffstown, Hooksett, Auburn)</li>
                <li><strong>Question keywords</strong> — "How much does a plumber cost in NH?" "When should I replace my furnace?" — these informational queries build authority</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Use our <a href="/blog/keyword-research-local-seo.html">keyword research guide</a> to find these opportunities.</p>

            <h2>The Competitive Overtake Timeline</h2>

            <p>How long does it take to outrank an established competitor? It depends on the gap:</p>

            <div class="table-wrapper">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Gap Size</th>
                            <th>Description</th>
                            <th>Timeline</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>Small</td><td>Similar reviews, similar website, you just need optimization</td><td>2-4 months</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Medium</td><td>They have 2-3x more reviews, better website, some content</td><td>4-8 months</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Large</td><td>Established brand, 200+ reviews, strong website, active content</td><td>8-14 months</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Very Large</td><td>Dominant player, 500+ reviews, years of content, strong links</td><td>12-24 months</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p>Important: you don't need to overtake them on everything at once. <a href="/blog/how-long-seo-takes.html">SEO is a long game</a>, and <strong>consistent effort over time always beats sporadic bursts</strong>.</p>

                <li><strong>Copying competitors instead of analyzing them</strong> — Don't replicate; improve on what they do</li>
                <li><strong>Focusing on one factor</strong> — Rankings are multi-factor. Reviews alone won't overcome a terrible website.</li>
                <li><strong>Giving up too early</strong> — Most businesses quit after 2-3 months when they don't see instant results</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring their own strengths</strong> — Maybe you have better service, niche expertise, or community ties. Lean into those.</li>
                <li><strong>Obsessing over rankings</strong> — <a href="/blog/track-seo-results.html">Track calls, forms, and revenue</a> — that's what actually matters</li>
                <li><strong>Not tracking progress</strong> — Without measurement, you don't know if your strategy is working. Use <a href="/blog/google-analytics-local-business.html">analytics</a> and <a href="/blog/google-search-console-local-seo.html">Search Console</a>.</li>

            <h2>The 30-Day Competitive Sprint</h2>

            <p>If you want to start closing the gap immediately, here's a 30-day action plan:</p>

            <h3>Week 1: Intelligence</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete the competitor scorecard for your top 3 competitors</li>
                <li>Identify the top 3 gaps to close first</li>
                <li>Set up <a href="/blog/google-analytics-local-business.html">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="/blog/google-search-console-local-seo.html">Search Console</a> if not already</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 2: GBP Optimization</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete your GBP to 100%</li>
                <li>Upload 20+ high-quality photos</li>
                <li>Write your first 2 GBP posts</li>
                <li>Send review requests to your last 20 customers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 3: Website</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Optimize title tags and meta descriptions on your top 5 pages</li>
                <li>Add <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">schema markup</a> to your homepage</li>
                <li>Create 1 new service page targeting a gap keyword</li>
                <li>Fix any <a href="/blog/website-speed-optimization.html">speed issues</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 4: Content + Links</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Publish your first blog post targeting a keyword competitors miss</li>
                <li>Submit to 5 local directories you're missing</li>
                <li>Reach out to 3 potential local partners for backlinks</li>
                <li>Continue collecting reviews (aim for 5+ this week)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Outranking competitors isn't about one big move — it's about <strong>winning more small battles than they do, consistently, over time</strong>. Better GBP, more reviews, stronger website, deeper content, more links, faster speed. Each improvement compounds.</p>

            <p>Your competitors are probably not actively optimizing. They got their rankings by being around longer or having more reviews. <strong>An active, strategic approach will overtake a passive one</strong> — it just takes patience and consistency.</p>

            <p>Start with the competitor scorecard. Know exactly where you stand. Then close one gap at a time, starting with the easiest wins first.</p>
