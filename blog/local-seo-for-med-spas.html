            <p class="intro-text">Med spas are one of the fastest-growing segments in the aesthetics industry. Treatments valued at $200 to $5,000+ per procedure, minimal insurance coverage (patients pay out of pocket), and zero offline marketing ROI make med spas perfect for digital acquisition. The problem: every med spa, dermatology office, and aesthetics clinic is competing for the same high-intent searches like "Botox near me," "laser hair removal," and "med spa near me." Whoever dominates Google gets the patient calls. Everyone else gets nothing.</p>

            <p>This guide covers everything you need to rank in Google's Local Pack, convert treatment page visitors into consultations, and track exactly which SEO efforts drive patient acquisition and revenue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Why Med Spas Need SEO (And Why It Works)</h2>

            <p>Unlike many service industries, med spa patients <strong>start with Google</strong>. They're not browsing the Yellow Pages or asking friends. They search "Botox near me," "laser hair removal [city]," or "med spa for microneedling," and they expect to see results within 5 miles. If you're not in that Local Pack, they choose a competitor.</p>

            <h3>The Med Spa Market Advantage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High patient lifetime value</strong> — $200–$5,000+ per treatment, with repeat bookings (Botox every 3 months, laser packages across seasons)</li>
                <li><strong>No insurance friction</strong> — Patients pay directly, no authorization delays or billing disputes</li>
                <li><strong>High-intent keywords</strong> — "Botox near me" isn't window shopping; it's a patient ready to book</li>
                <li><strong>Geographic dominance</strong> — Control your city, multiply revenue across locations</li>
                <li><strong>Growing market</strong> — Aesthetics spending increased 17% year-over-year (2024–2025); younger demographics now represent 30% of med spa clients</li>
            </ul>

            <p>SEO is the highest-ROI acquisition channel for med spas because it captures demand that already exists. You're not creating the need; you're being there when patients are ready to buy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Google Business Profile Optimization for Med Spas</h2>

            <p>Your GBP is the foundation of local visibility. For med spas, it's more critical than your website because patients often make appointment decisions directly from the GBP card (no click-through required).</p>

            <h3>Choosing the Right Primary Category</h3>
            <p>Google has multiple med spa-relevant categories. Choose based on your core focus:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Medical Spa"</strong> — Best for full-service med spas offering diverse treatments (injectables, lasers, body contouring)</li>
                <li><strong>"Skin Care Clinic"</strong> — For med spas emphasizing skincare (facials, peels, microneedling) alongside injectables</li>
                <li><strong>"Laser Hair Removal Service"</strong> — If laser hair removal is 30%+ of your revenue and a key differentiator</li>
                <li><strong>"Cosmetic Dermatology"</strong> — For medical spas run by or affiliated with board-certified dermatologists</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Rule:</strong> If you're unsure, use "Medical Spa" (broadest, highest search volume). Then layer treatment-specific categories as secondaries.</p>

            <h3>Treatment-Specific Secondary Categories</h3>
            <p>Add 5–7 of these as secondaries to appear in treatment-specific searches:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>"Botox Injection"</li>
                <li>"Dermal Filler Service"</li>
                <li>"Laser Hair Removal Service"</li>
                <li>"Microneedling Service"</li>
                <li>"Chemical Peel Service"</li>
                <li>"Skin Care Clinic"</li>
                <li>"Laser Resurfacing Service"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Test which categories Google actually recognizes for your location (type each into the GBP category field; Google suggests available options). If a category doesn't auto-complete, it doesn't exist yet.</p>

            <h3>Service Attributes (Critical for Med Spas)</h3>
            <p>GBP's "Services" section is where patients discover specific treatments. Fill this completely:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Botox Injections</li>
                <li>Dermal Fillers (Juvéderm, Restylane, Radiesse, etc.)</li>
                <li>Laser Hair Removal</li>
                <li>Laser Skin Resurfacing</li>
                <li>Microneedling</li>
                <li>Chemical Peels</li>
                <li>Body Contouring (CoolSculpting, EMSculpt, etc.)</li>
                <li>Facials (Hydrafacials, laser facials, etc.)</li>
                <li>Skin Tightening</li>
                <li>Consultation Services</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each service adds a new landing point in Google's internal index. Patients searching "Hydrafacial near me" or "CoolSculpting [city]" may discover you through these attributes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Building Dedicated Treatment Pages</h2>

            <p>Your homepage cannot rank for "Botox near me" because Google needs proof that you specifically offer Botox (not just injectables generally). Each major treatment needs its own page.</p>

            <h3>Essential Treatment Pages</h3>
            <p>Create dedicated pages for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Botox</strong> — Your #1 search driver; separate pages for preventative and anti-wrinkle use cases</li>
                <li><strong>Dermal Fillers</strong> — Generic page covering all brands, plus individual pages for Juvéderm, Restylane, Radiesse (if significant revenue)</li>
                <li><strong>Laser Hair Removal</strong> — High search volume, repeatable revenue</li>
                <li><strong>Microneedling</strong> — Growing market; rapidly increasing search volume</li>
                <li><strong>Chemical Peels</strong> — Seasonal demand (pre-event, pre-summer)</li>
                <li><strong>Body Contouring</strong> — Covers CoolSculpting, EMSculpt, Emsella, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Laser Resurfacing</strong> — Combines fractional laser and CO2 laser under one page (or split if different providers)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Treatment Page Structure</h3>
            <p>Each page should follow this framework:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>H1 Title</strong> — "[Treatment] in [City] | [Clinic Name]" (e.g., "Botox in Boston | Glow Med Spa")</li>
                <li><strong>Lead section</strong> — "Is Botox right for me?" problem/solution hook. Mention cost range ($10–$20 per unit, typical 20 units = $200–$400)</li>
                <li><strong>How it works</strong> — Step-by-step what to expect (consultation, injection, results timeline)</li>
                <li><strong>Before/after gallery</strong> — See section below on consent and compliance</li>
                <li><strong>Candidacy guide</strong> — Who benefits, common myths, contraindications</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery expectations</strong> — Downtime, side effects, when results appear</li>
                <li><strong>Cost & pricing</strong> — Be transparent. "Starting at $X" or pricing range. Builds trust and filters unqualified leads</li>
                <li><strong>Provider credentials</strong> — Injector names, certifications, years of experience</li>
                <li><strong>FAQ section</strong> — Address comparison questions ("Botox vs. Fillers?"), results duration, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>CTA</strong> — "Book consultation" button; form or calendar link above the fold and at page end</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Each page should be 1,500–2,500 words, including the gallery captions and FAQ.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Before/After Gallery Strategy (With HIPAA Compliance)</h2>

            <p>Before/after images are the #1 conversion driver for med spas. They're also the #1 compliance risk. Here's how to do it legally.</p>

            <h3>Consent & HIPAA Basics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Written consent required</strong> — Before any before/after photo can be published, the patient must sign a photo release form. Generic "terms of service" don't count. Separate, explicit consent is required.</li>
                <li><strong>HIPAA doesn't ban photos</strong> — It requires consent for use. If a patient consents, you can publish. If they don't, you can't.</li>
                <li><strong>Restrict to your own patients</strong> — Only use before/afters from patients you've personally treated. Never license or republish others' photos without explicit written permission from the original subject.</li>
                <li><strong>No identifying information</strong> — Crop out faces if showing body treatments. If showing face, ensure the patient is unrecognizable or has consented to facial visibility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Photo Release Form Template</h3>
            <p>Add this language to your consent form:</p>

            <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #10b981; padding-left: 16px; margin: 20px 0; color: #666;">
                <p>"I consent to the use of before and after photographs of my treatment results in [clinic name]'s marketing materials, website, social media, and patient testimonials. I understand these photos may be used to promote services and educate potential patients. I retain the right to withdraw this consent at any time by written request."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Gallery Best Practices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organize by treatment</strong> — Keep all Botox results together, all fillers together, etc. Allows side-by-side comparison.</li>
                <li><strong>Show variety</strong> — Different ages, skin types, ethnicities. Prospective patients need to see results for people who look like them.</li>
                <li><strong>Label with treatment details</strong> — Example: "Botox (20 units) + Juvéderm Ultra Plus (1 syringe) | 2-week results" — builds treatment understanding and expectation-setting</li>
                <li><strong>Timestamp results</strong> — Include the timeframe post-treatment. Patients need to know "this is 2-week results" vs "this is 4-week results" because perception changes over time</li>
                <li><strong>Real patient outcomes</strong> — Avoid heavily edited photos. Natural, realistic results build more trust than Instagram-filtered perfection</li>
                <li><strong>Update regularly</strong> — Rotate new galleries monthly. Google's image crawler indexes fresh images more frequently</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Legal Alternative: Anonymous/Unidentifiable Before/Afters</h3>
            <p>If you're uncomfortable obtaining consent, you can publish before/after images that don't show identifying features:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Extreme close-ups of skin texture (no face visible)</li>
                <li>Full-body body contouring shots with face cropped out</li>
                <li>Lip augmentation: lips only, no facial context</li>
                <li>Neck/décolletage shots: no face, just the treatment area</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These still demonstrate results without compliance risk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Content Strategy: The High-Intent Content Stack</h2>

            <p>Beyond treatment pages, create supporting content that answers patient questions and captures secondary search demand.</p>

            <h3>Treatment Comparison Pages</h3>
            <p>Create pages comparing treatments patients are actively researching:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>"Botox vs. Dermal Fillers: Which Is Right for You?"</li>
                <li>"Juvéderm vs. Restylane: Differences and Which Lasts Longer"</li>
                <li>"Laser Hair Removal vs. Electrolysis: Permanent Hair Removal Compared"</li>
                <li>"CoolSculpting vs. Emsculpt: Non-Surgical Body Contouring Compared"</li>
                <li>"Chemical Peels vs. Microneedling: Which Works Better?"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These pages rank for high-intent modifiers like "vs." and help patients narrow decisions toward your clinic (ideally landing on a treatment page or CTA).</p>

            <h3>Candidacy Guides</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"Who Is a Good Candidate for Botox?"</li>
                <li>"Am I Too Young for Preventative Botox?"</li>
                <li>"Can I Get Fillers if I'm Pregnant or Breastfeeding?"</li>
                <li>"Laser Hair Removal for Dark Skin Tones: What You Need to Know"</li>
                <li>"Microneedling for Acne Scars: Does It Really Work?"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These address common objections and build authority on safety/appropriateness (E-E-A-T trust).</p>

            <h3>Recovery Timeline & Aftercare Pages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"Botox Recovery: Timeline, Side Effects, and Aftercare"</li>
                <li>"Filler Aftercare: What to Avoid After Dermal Injections"</li>
                <li>"Laser Hair Removal Aftercare: Pre- and Post-Treatment Instructions"</li>
                <li>"Microneedling Recovery: How Long Until You Look Normal?"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Patients often search these questions post-booking (or pre-booking to understand commitment). Rank for them and you're the authority they trust.</p>

            <h3>Seasonal & Promotional Content</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"Botox Bridal: Prep Your Skin 6 Weeks Before Your Wedding"</li>
                <li>"New Year, New You: Your Med Spa Resolution Guide"</li>
                <li>"Summer Body: CoolSculpting and Skin Treatments Before Beach Season"</li>
                <li>"Holiday Party Glow: Last-Minute Skin Treatments"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Time these to rank during peak demand windows (content should publish 4–6 weeks before peak season to build authority ranking).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Review Strategy: Building Trust & Ranking Authority</h2>

            <p>For med spas, reviews are split trust: patient reviews on Google/Yelp build social proof, while provider credentials (medical director bios, injector certifications) build E-A-T authority.</p>

            <h3>Getting More Treatment Reviews</h3>
            <p>Most patients don't leave reviews unless prompted. Implement this post-appointment flow:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>In-clinic</strong> — Hand a card with a QR code linking to your Google review page (easier than typing a URL)</li>
                <li><strong>SMS follow-up</strong> — 3 days post-treatment: "How did your [Botox/filler/laser] treatment go? We'd love your feedback" + review link</li>
                <li><strong>Email follow-up</strong> — 1 week post-treatment: Review request + aftercare reminders (stacking multiple value points)</li>
                <li><strong>In-app prompt</strong> — If you have a booking app, prompt review immediately post-appointment</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Never incentivize reviews</strong> (no "leave a review and get $50 off"). This violates platform policies and Google specifically. Incentives must be for a review experience (e.g., free consultation evaluation), not the review itself.</p>

            <h3>Handling Negative Reviews (Results Complaints)</h3>
            <p>Aesthetics complaints are unique: "Results weren't what I expected" isn't a service failure; it's an expectation-setting failure. Here's how to respond:</p>

            <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #10b981; padding-left: 16px; margin: 20px 0; color: #666;">
                <p>"We're sorry you didn't feel the results matched your expectations. Botox results vary by individual and typically improve over 7–14 days. We'd love to schedule a complimentary follow-up consultation to discuss enhancement options. Please call us at [phone]."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><strong>Key elements:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Validate the concern (don't dismiss)</li>
                <li>Educate (remind about recovery timeline/variability)</li>
                <li>Offer a solution (follow-up, touch-up, or next steps)</li>
                <li>Invite private conversation (don't debate review publicly)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Many patients remove negative reviews after you respond with solutions. Even if they don't, the response signals to other patients that you care about outcomes.</p>

            <h2>E-E-A-T for Medical Content: Building Trust at Scale</h2>

            <p><a href="/blog/e-e-a-t-seo.html">E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trustworthiness)</a> is Google's primary ranking signal for medical content. For med spas, this means provider credentials matter as much as content quality.</p>

            <h3>Medical Director Bio Page</h3>
            <p>Create a dedicated page (or section) for your medical director. Include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Board certifications</strong> — "Board-certified dermatologist (American Board of Dermatology)" or "Board-certified plastic surgeon (American Society of Plastic Surgeons)"</li>
                <li><strong>License verification</strong> — Link to state medical board (e.g., "Verify license on [State] Medical Board" with link)</li>
                <li><strong>Education</strong> — Medical school, residency, fellowship (if specialty medicine)</li>
                <li><strong>Years of practice</strong> — "20+ years in cosmetic dermatology"</li>
                <li><strong>Specializations</strong> — Which treatments they've trained in (especially if undergoing additional training for injectables, lasers, body contouring)</li>
                <li><strong>Published work</strong> — Any publications, conference presentations, or professional affiliations</li>
                <li><strong>Professional memberships</strong> — ASDS (American Society for Dermatologic Surgery), AAD (American Academy of Dermatology), ASLMS (American Society for Laser Medicine & Surgery), etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Include a professional headshot. Patients want to see who's injecting them.</p>

            <h3>Injector Credentials Section</h3>
            <p>Each injector should have listed:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Name and title (RN, NP, PA-C, MD, etc.)</li>
                <li>Training certifications (e.g., "Allergan-certified Botox injector," "Juvéderm training certified")</li>
                <li>Years of experience injecting</li>
                <li>Specialties (if applicable: lips, jawline, rhinoplasty alternatives, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Schema Markup for Medical Authority</h3>
            <p>Add <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">schema markup</a> to your medical director bio page:</p>

            <h2>Local Citations for Med Spas</h2>

            <p>Citations (mentions of your business name, address, phone) on trusted medical directories build local authority and drive direct patient referrals.</p>

            <h3>Priority Medical Directories</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong><a href="https://www.realself.com" target="_blank">RealSelf</a></strong> — The #1 cosmetic procedure review site. Patients research Botox costs, read reviews, and book directly from RealSelf. Claim your profile immediately and keep it updated.</li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://www.healthgrades.com" target="_blank">Healthgrades</a></strong> — Multi-specialty directory. Include your medical director and accept patient reviews. Ranks in Google Knowledge Panel.</li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://www.zocdoc.com" target="_blank">ZocDoc</a></strong> — For providers offering consultations. Patients book appointments directly on ZocDoc.</li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a></strong> — High search volume for med spa reviews. Yelp listings often rank above your website in Google.</li>

                <li><strong>ASDS Directory</strong> — American Society for Dermatologic Surgery. Get medical director listed if they're a member.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Maps / Google Business Profile</strong> — (Covered above, but bears repeating: optimize ruthlessly)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Citation Consistency</h3>
            <p>Use the exact same business name, address, and phone across all directories. Inconsistencies confuse Google's local algorithm:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Business name:</strong> "Glow Med Spa" not "Glow Medical Spa" (pick one spelling everywhere)</li>
                <li><strong>Address:</strong> "123 Main St, Suite 200, Boston, MA 02101" (include suite number consistently; don't abbreviate "St" in some places and spell out in others)</li>
                <li><strong>Phone:</strong> Format all as (603) 605-8532, not 603-605-8532 or 6036058532</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Competitor Analysis: Med Spas vs. Dermatologists vs. Plastic Surgeons</h2>

            <p>In any city, you're competing against dermatologists and plastic surgeons for the same search traffic. Understand their advantages and build defensible differences.</p>

            <h3>Competitor Categories</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Med spas (like you)</strong> — Lower cost, faster appointments, newer tech, treat aesthetics as their only focus</li>
                <li><strong>Dermatology practices</strong> — Board-certified MD, insurance coverage for medical treatments, medical credibility advantage, slower booking</li>
                <li><strong>Plastic surgery practices</strong> — Surgical expertise (liposuction, breast), highest trust authority, most expensive, longest wait</li>
                <li><strong>Esthetician-only spas</strong> — Lowest cost, widest service breadth (massage + skin), lowest medical authority</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Your Differentiation Strategy</h3>

            <p>You're not outpacing dermatologists on credentials. Instead, compete on:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Speed</strong> — "Same-day consultation and treatment" vs. dermatology's 4-week wait</li>
                <li><strong>Affordability</strong> — "20 units of Botox starting at $X" vs. dermatology's premium pricing</li>
                <li><strong>Specialization</strong> — "Botox and fillers specialists, not skin disease management"</li>
                <li><strong>Technology</strong> — "Latest laser technology" (but only if actually true; verify you have newer hardware than competitors)</li>
                <li><strong>Experience</strong> — Injector experience (e.g., "All our injectors have 10+ years cosmetic injection experience")</li>
                <li><strong>Results focus</strong> — Before/after galleries showing natural, beautiful results (not over-injected)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Content strategy: Create comparison pages like "Med Spa vs. Dermatology Office: Which Is Right for Your Botox Appointment?" Address the question head-on, build credibility, and guide patients toward your model's advantages.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Patient Acquisition & Treatment ROI</h2>

            <p>SEO is only valuable if you can tie it to revenue. Here's how to track med spa patient acquisition from Google.</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Goal Tracking in Google Analytics</h3>
            <p>Set up these conversion goals:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consultation requests</strong> — Form submission or calendar booking</li>
                <li><strong>Phone calls</strong> — (603) 605-8532 clicks (enable call tracking with a local tracking number if desired)</li>
                <li><strong>Chat inquiries</strong> — If you have live chat, track messages sent</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment page views</strong> — Secondary goal; track visits to Botox page, filler page, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In Google Analytics 4: Events > Conversion > Create new event. Map these to your website interactions (form submission, call button click, etc.).</p>

            <h3>Step 2: UTM Parameters for Paid & Email</h3>
            <p>If running ads or email campaigns, tag URLs to isolate performance:</p>

            <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #10b981; padding-left: 16px; margin: 20px 0; color: #666; font-size: 12px;">
                Google Ads landing page: https://yoursite.com/botox?utm_source=google_ads&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=botox_boston<br/><br/>
                Email campaign: https://yoursite.com/filler-special?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=new_year_promo
            </blockquote>

            <p>This isolates organic vs. paid vs. email so you know which channel drives which treatments.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Booking Integration & CRM Tracking</h3>
            <p>Your booking system (Acuity, Vagaro, Jane App, etc.) should track:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appointment source</strong> — How did the patient find you? (Google, Facebook, referral, etc.). Most booking systems have a "how did you hear about us?" field</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment selected</strong> — Which service they booked (Botox, filler, laser, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Amount paid</strong> — Revenue per treatment</li>
                <li><strong>Follow-up bookings</strong> — Track repeat patients (critical for LTV analysis)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Export this monthly to a spreadsheet and cross-reference with Analytics conversion data.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Simple ROI Math</h3>

            <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #10b981; padding-left: 16px; margin: 20px 0; color: #666;">
                <p><strong>Monthly SEO Cost (or allocated time):</strong> $1,500 (your cost or freelancer fee)<br/>
                <strong>SEO Conversions This Month:</strong> 12 consultations booked from Google<br/>
                <strong>Conversion Rate to Paid Treatment:</strong> 75% (9 patients actually complete treatment)<br/>
                <strong>Average Treatment Value:</strong> $350 (mix of Botox at $300, fillers at $450)<br/>
                <strong>Monthly Revenue from SEO:</strong> 9 × $350 = $3,150<br/>
                <strong>Monthly ROI:</strong> ($3,150 - $1,500) / $1,500 = 110% ROI</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>That's conservative. Once SEO matures (typically 6–12 months), SEO-driven revenue often scales to 2–3x monthly SEO investment.</p>

            <h3>Track Repeat Revenue Separately</h3>
            <p>Med spas are repeat-revenue businesses. A patient who books Botox often books fillers 2 months later. Track:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Patient LTV</strong> — Total revenue per patient over their lifetime (not just first booking)</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat booking rate</strong> — % of first-time patients who return within 6 months</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment bundling</strong> — % of patients who add a second treatment to their initial booking</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This reveals true SEO ROI: the initial patient you acquired through "Botox near me" may eventually generate $2,000+ in LTV (Botox + fillers + laser + peels across a year).</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Quick Med Spa SEO Checklist</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>GBP:</strong> Category set to "Medical Spa" or "Skin Care Clinic." 5+ treatment-specific secondary categories added. Services section filled completely with all treatments offered.</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment pages:</strong> At least 7 dedicated pages (Botox, fillers, laser hair removal, microneedling, chemical peels, body contouring, skin tightening). 1,500+ words each with before/afters, recovery timelines, and pricing.</li>
                <li><strong>Before/After gallery:</strong> Consent forms signed for all visible patients. 20+ images per major treatment. Updated monthly.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical director bio:</strong> Credentials, board certification, license verification, years of experience. Schema markup added.</li>
                <li><strong>Citations:</strong> Profiles claimed and optimized on RealSelf, Healthgrades, ZocDoc, Yelp, state medical board. Consistent NAP (name, address, phone) everywhere.</li>
                <li><strong>Review strategy:</strong> Post-treatment review requests via SMS and email. Response templates for negative reviews.</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Conversion goals tracking consultations and phone calls. UTM parameters on all campaigns. Booking system tracking source and treatment value.</li>
                <li><strong>Competitor analysis:</strong> Quarterly review of top 5 competitors' rankings, GBP categories, treatment pages, review counts.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Med spas have the perfect business model for SEO: high-value treatments, geographic targeting, zero offline marketing efficiency, and patient demand that starts on Google. Most med spas leave thousands of dollars on the table every month because they either skip SEO entirely or optimize only their homepage.</p>

            <p>The med spas winning right now have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Optimized GBP with all treatment attributes filled</li>
                <li>Dedicated pages for each major treatment (Botox, fillers, lasers, body sculpting)</li>
                <li>Before/after galleries that showcase real, beautiful results</li>
                <li>Provider credentials positioned prominently for E-A-T trust</li>
                <li>Active review management and response strategy</li>
                <li>Analytics tracking that ties consultations back to revenue</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you're investing in paid ads, paid ads + SEO combined will always outperform paid alone. SEO captures the searchers you'd otherwise send to competitors. Start with the GBP optimization and treatment pages this month. Within 90 days, you'll be capturing high-intent patient searches you're currently losing.</p>
