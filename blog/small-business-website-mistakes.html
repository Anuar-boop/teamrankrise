            <p class="intro-text">Every day your website is active, it's either bringing customers in or pushing them away. Most small businesses don't realize their site is quietly destroying their business — because the problems aren't always obvious. A visitor might leave without ever scrolling, clicking, or calling. You'll never know they were there.</p>

            <p>This guide covers the 15 most costly website mistakes we see across NH small businesses. Each one is costing you real customers, real revenue, and real growth. More importantly: each one is fixable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>1. No Mobile Responsiveness (The 60% Problem)</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> Your website looks great on desktop but falls apart on phones. Text is too small, buttons are unclickable, images don't load properly, or the layout is a scrambled mess.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Over 60% of web traffic comes from mobile devices. If your site isn't mobile-friendly, you're rejecting 6 out of every 10 potential customers before they even see what you offer. Google also penalizes non-responsive sites in search rankings, meaning you lose visibility twice.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Use the free <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly" target="_blank">Google Mobile-Friendly Test</a> to see exactly what needs work. If you're using WordPress or Wix, enable their responsive themes (most modern ones are built-in). If you built your site with code, test on iPhones, Android phones, and tablets. Every element should be clickable and readable at 375px width (iPhone SE size). Consider a mobile-first redesign if the current site is too outdated.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>2. Slow Page Speed (Every Second Costs 7%)</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> Visitors click your site and wait. And wait. And close the tab. Your page takes 5+ seconds to load when it should take 2.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Research shows that every additional second of load time costs 7% in conversions. A 5-second site vs. a 2-second site loses 21% of your customers just waiting for the page to appear. Slow sites also rank lower in Google, so you lose organic traffic on top of conversion losses.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Start with Google PageSpeed Insights (free). It will tell you exactly what's slow. Common culprits: uncompressed images (compress them via Tinypng or Squoosh), too many plugins (deactivate unused ones), large video files (use services like Vimeo that stream instead of host), and outdated hosting (upgrade to at least a decent shared hosting plan). Enable caching, use a CDN (Cloudflare is free), and minify your CSS and JavaScript. Aim for under 3 seconds on mobile.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>3. No Clear Call-to-Action Above the Fold</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> Visitors land on your homepage and have no idea what to do next. There's no obvious button to "Call," "Get a Quote," "Schedule," or "Buy." They have to hunt.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The "fold" is the part of your page visible without scrolling. If your CTA isn't there, most visitors never see it. They'll leave instead of taking action. A clear CTA can increase conversions by 50%+.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Place a prominent CTA button or contact information within the first 300 pixels of your page (before they scroll). Use contrasting colors (green or orange typically outperform blue). Make it say exactly what happens when they click: "Call Now," "Book a Free Consultation," "Order Today," not vague labels like "Submit" or "Click Here." Include your phone number as clickable text on mobile. Test different placements and monitor which gets more clicks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>4. Missing or Broken Contact Information</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> Your phone number is only on the contact page (which nobody visits). Your email address has a typo. Your hours are listed as "call for hours." Your address is outdated.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If a customer wants to reach you and can't find your info, they won't search harder—they'll call your competitor. Missing contact details also hurt your local search rankings because Google can't verify your business exists.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Place your phone number in the header of every page (not just contact page). Include your full address and hours. Make your phone number clickable on mobile. Add your email address and all social media profiles. Verify your information is consistent across your site, <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-categories-guide.html">Google Business Profile</a>, and directory listings. Update hours if seasonal. Consider a contact form as a backup, but don't make it the only option.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>5. No Google Business Profile Link or Integration</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> Your Google Business Profile exists separately from your website. They don't connect. Your website doesn't link to your GBP, and your GBP doesn't link to your website. They're two separate islands.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Your GBP is often the first thing potential customers see in Google Search and Maps. If it doesn't link to your website, they can't easily learn more. Google also expects consistency between your GBP and website. Disconnected information signals to Google that something's wrong, hurting your <a href="/blog/google-local-pack-ranking.html">Local Pack rankings</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Log into your <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-description.html">Google Business Profile</a> and ensure the website URL is filled in correctly and links to your homepage. On your website footer or contact section, add a link to your GBP. Include your full address and phone number on your website (match exactly what's in GBP). Make sure your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) are identical everywhere — even slight variations hurt rankings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>6. Stock Photos Instead of Real Business Photos</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> Your homepage shows generic stock photos: a smiling woman in a headset, a handshake, a team in a conference room. Nobody believes it's your business.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Real photos of your actual business, team, and customers build trust instantly. Stock photos do the opposite—they scream "this company isn't real" or "too corporate to care." Real photos also get better engagement on social media, click-through rates, and conversion rates. They're unique to you, so they can't be copied by competitors.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Take photos of your team, your office, your products, your customers (with permission), and your work in progress. Use your phone camera if needed—modern iPhones take excellent photos. If you need professional shots, hire a local photographer for a half-day shoot (usually $500-1500 for a small business). Use a mix: some professional, some candid behind-the-scenes. Replace stock photos immediately. Make sure outdoor photos show your real storefront and signage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>7. No Customer Reviews or Testimonials on Site</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> Your website is all about you. "We're great, we do X, we've been in business Y years." No actual customers backing you up.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Customers trust other customers more than they trust you. A site with zero testimonials is less convincing than one with just 3-5 genuine reviews. Real reviews increase conversion rates by 30-40%. They also improve your <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-categories-guide.html">Google Business Profile rankings</a>—the more reviews you have, the higher you rank.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Display testimonials prominently on your homepage. Ask satisfied customers for short written reviews or video testimonials (video converts best). Include their name, photo, and what they do (e.g., "Sarah M., Restaurant Owner"). Link to your Google Business Profile where full reviews live. Ask for reviews on invoices, after service, and via follow-up emails. Respond to all reviews—positive and negative—professionally and publicly. The act of responding increases engagement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>8. Missing SSL Certificate (No HTTPS)</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> Your site is http:// instead of https://. The padlock icon is missing from the browser address bar.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Visitors see a "Not Secure" warning in their browser. Instantly, you look untrustworthy. Google heavily penalizes non-HTTPS sites in search rankings. Visitors are also more likely to bounce (leave immediately) when they see that warning. If you collect any customer data (emails, payment info), you're breaking the law without HTTPS.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Install an SSL certificate on your hosting account (most hosts offer free Let's Encrypt certificates). If you use WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, or Shopify, SSL is usually included automatically. Once installed, update all your links and resources to https://. Set up a permanent redirect from http:// to https://. Use Google Search Console to verify the HTTPS version is indexed. This takes 30 minutes and costs $0-50.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>9. No Local Schema Markup</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> Your website doesn't tell Google exactly who you are. Google has to guess your business type, location, and services from scattered content.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Schema markup is code that tells Google "this business is a plumber, located in Manchester NH, open 8am-5pm weekdays." Without it, Google has to interpret your content (and often gets it wrong). With it, you rank higher in Local Pack results because Google understands you immediately. This is especially critical for local businesses competing in their city.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Add LocalBusiness schema markup to your homepage. Tools like Google's Structured Data Markup Helper (free) make it easy. At minimum, include: business name, full address, phone number, business category, hours, website, and image. Use the <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">Schema Markup guide</a> to implement it correctly. If you use WordPress, use the Yoast SEO plugin (free version includes schema). Validate your markup using Google's Rich Results Test to ensure it's correct.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>10. Thin or Duplicate Content Across Service Pages</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> Every service page has the same 200 words with just the service name swapped out. Your plumbing site has "Plumbing Services," "Drain Cleaning Services," and "Water Heater Services"—but each page is nearly identical.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Google sees duplicate content as spam or laziness. It won't rank pages with duplicate content well. Thin content (under 300 words with no real information) gets buried. You're competing against yourself in search results instead of dominating. Each page also needs to be comprehensive enough to actually help the visitor decide to call.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Write unique, detailed content for each service. A water heater page should cover: why you need a new one, signs it's failing, installation process, maintenance tips, warranty info, pricing range, why you chose that brand. Aim for 500-1000 words per page. Make each page valuable enough that someone could read it and decide to hire you. Include photos and diagrams. Link related pages to each other. Use different images and examples for each service.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>11. No Blog or Fresh Content</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> Your website hasn't been updated since 2022. There's no blog. New content is never added. Google visits every month and sees nothing new.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Fresh content signals to Google that your business is active and relevant. Sites that publish new content rank higher than dormant ones. A blog also gives potential customers a reason to visit you multiple times (not just once). It builds trust by demonstrating expertise. Each blog post is a new page that can rank for new keywords, driving more organic traffic.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Start a simple blog. Publish at least 2-4 posts per month on topics your customers care about. Topic ideas: common problems, how-to guides, seasonal tips, local events, customer stories, FAQs. Each post should be 600-1500 words. This doesn't require expensive software—WordPress is free, Wix and Squarespace have built-in blogging. Repurpose your content across social media and email newsletters.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>12. Broken Links and 404 Pages</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> A visitor clicks an internal link and lands on "Page Not Found." External links point to pages that no longer exist. Download links are broken. Images aren't loading.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Broken links hurt user experience and make you look careless. They also hurt SEO—Google sees broken links as a sign of a low-quality site. If you link to an external site and that page goes away, you're sending your visitor (and your link equity) to a dead page. Internal broken links waste crawl budget.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Use a free tool like Broken Link Checker or Screaming Frog to audit your entire site. Fix all broken links. If an old blog post no longer exists, redirect it (301) to a similar new post instead of letting it 404. Check external links quarterly and update them if pages move. Make your 404 page helpful (include a search box and links to popular pages). Test all download links monthly to ensure files still exist and are correct versions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>13. Poor Navigation and Confusing Site Structure</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> Your menu is cluttered with 20 items. Pages are nested 5 levels deep. There's no breadcrumb trail. A visitor can't figure out how to find what they need.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> A visitor should find any page on your site in 2-3 clicks. If they can't, they leave. Poor navigation increases bounce rate and decreases time on site—both hurt SEO rankings. Confused navigation also reduces conversions because people can't find your services or pricing.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Simplify your main menu to 5-7 items max. Use clear labels (not clever names). Create a logical hierarchy: Home → Services → [specific service] → Contact. Use breadcrumbs at the top of inner pages. Add a site search function. Test your navigation with 5 people unfamiliar with your site—can they find key pages in under a minute? Create an XML sitemap and submit it to Google Search Console. Link related pages together.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>14. No Analytics or Tracking Installed</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> You don't know how many people visit your site, where they come from, which pages they visit, or where they leave. You're flying blind.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without data, you can't improve. You'll make changes and never know if they helped or hurt. Analytics reveal which pages convert, which drive traffic, which waste resources. This data is critical to making smart decisions about your site and your marketing budget.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Install Google Analytics 4 (free) on your site—it takes 5 minutes. Also install Google Search Console (free) to see which keywords bring you traffic. Install a phone call tracking service if calls are important (CallRail or CallTrackingMetrics). Set up conversion tracking for forms, emails, and phone calls. Review your analytics weekly. Pay attention to: traffic sources, bounce rate, most visited pages, conversion funnel, and goals completed. Use this data to optimize your site continuously.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>15. DIY SEO Mistakes (Keyword Stuffing, Hidden Text, Spam)</h2>

            <p><strong>What's wrong:</strong> You stuffed your homepage with keywords: "plumber plumber emergency plumber Manchester NH plumber." You've hidden white text on white background to trick Google. You've bought backlinks or joined link exchanges. Your site looks spammy.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Google's algorithm is designed to catch these tactics. Sites that use them get penalized—sometimes manually reviewed and demoted, sometimes algorithmically buried. One penalty can take months to recover from. These tactics don't work anymore and actually hurt you.</p>

            <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Write for humans first, SEO second. Use your main keyword naturally 1-2 times in your page title and 2-3 times in your content. Don't stuff. Use long-tail keywords (phrases like "emergency plumber Manchester NH" not just "plumber") naturally. Never hide text. Never buy links. Focus on: excellent content, real reviews, mobile optimization, fast page speed, and genuine links from relevant sites. If you're unsure whether something is a "black hat" tactic, don't do it. See our <a href="/blog/nh-seo-checklist-2026.html">NH SEO Checklist</a> for white-hat best practices.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>The Cost of Inaction</h2>

            <p>How many of these 15 mistakes is your website making right now? If you're making 5+ of them, you're definitely losing customers. If you're making 10+, you might be losing 30-50% of potential business.</p>

            <p>The good news: most of these are fixable in days, not months. Mobile responsiveness, page speed, clear CTAs, contact info, SSL certificate, and schema markup can all be addressed in your first week. Blog content, reviews, and navigation improvements take a bit longer but compound over time.</p>

            <p>Start with the 3 that are easiest for you to fix. Get those done. Then move to the next 3. You'll start seeing results—more traffic, more inquiries, more calls—within 30-60 days.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>What to Do Next</h2>

            <p>Audit your site against these 15 mistakes. Make a list of which ones apply to you. Prioritize by impact: mobile responsiveness and page speed affect the most visitors, so fix those first. CTAs and contact info affect conversion rate, so those are second. Content and SEO improve over time, so those can be ongoing.</p>

            <p>You can fix most of these yourself with free tools. Some might need professional help (especially redesign or development). Either way, the cost of fixing these mistakes is far, far less than the cost of continuing to make them.</p>

            <p>Most important: don't let perfect be the enemy of good. You don't need a perfect website. You need a website that converts. Start fixing these mistakes today, and you'll start seeing results this month.</p>
