        <p>We get it. You're a hands-on business owner. You built your company from scratch, and you figure SEO can't be <em>that</em> hard. So you watch a few YouTube videos, install a WordPress plugin, and start making changes.</p>

        <p>Six months later? Nothing's changed. Maybe things got <em>worse</em>.</p>

        <p>We've audited hundreds of New Hampshire business websites. The same DIY mistakes show up again and again. Here are the 10 most common ones — and exactly what to do instead.</p>

        <h2>Mistake #1: Targeting the Wrong Keywords</h2>

        <p>This is the single biggest mistake we see. A plumber in <a href="/seo-manchester-nh.html">Manchester, NH</a> targeting "plumbing" instead of "emergency plumber Manchester NH." A restaurant going after "best food" instead of "Italian restaurant Nashua NH."</p>

        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Generic keywords have massive competition from national brands. You'll never rank for "plumbing" against Home Depot and Angi. But "24 hour plumber Manchester NH" — that's a keyword you can own.</p>

        <p><strong>What to do instead:</strong> Focus on local, intent-driven keywords. Every keyword should include your service + your city. Use Google's autocomplete to find what people actually search for. Our <a href="/blog/local-seo-guide-nh.html">complete local SEO guide</a> walks through keyword research step by step.</p>

        <h2>Mistake #2: Ignoring Google Business Profile</h2>

        <p>Many business owners either don't have a Google Business Profile or set it up once and forgot about it three years ago. Meanwhile, their competitors post weekly updates, respond to reviews, and fill every field.</p>

        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> GBP is the #1 factor for appearing in the <a href="/blog/google-maps-ranking-nh.html">Google Map Pack</a> — those three business listings at the top of local searches. No GBP optimization = invisible on Maps.</p>

        <p><strong>What to do instead:</strong> Claim and fully complete your profile. Add photos weekly. Post updates. Respond to every review within 24 hours. Read our <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-tips.html">7 GBP tips that actually increase calls</a> for the full playbook.</p>

        <h2>Mistake #3: Keyword Stuffing</h2>

        <p>We still see pages that read like this: "Looking for the best plumber in Manchester NH? Our Manchester NH plumbing company offers the best plumbing services in Manchester NH and surrounding Manchester NH areas."</p>

        <p>Google hasn't rewarded keyword stuffing since 2012. Today, it actually <em>hurts</em> your rankings.</p>

        <p><strong>What to do instead:</strong> Write naturally. Use your target keyword in the page title, H1 heading, and first paragraph. Then write for humans. Google's AI understands context — you don't need to repeat phrases 47 times. Check our <a href="/blog/website-seo-checklist.html">15-point SEO checklist</a> for the right balance.</p>

        <h2>Mistake #4: Neglecting Mobile</h2>

        <p>Over 60% of local searches happen on phones. If your website looks broken, loads slowly, or has tiny text on mobile, you're losing more than half your potential customers before they even read a word.</p>

        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Google uses mobile-first indexing. Your mobile site IS your site in Google's eyes. A poor mobile experience directly tanks your rankings.</p>

        <p><strong>What to do instead:</strong> Test your site on your phone right now. Can you read it without zooming? Can you tap buttons easily? Does it load in under 3 seconds? If you answer "no" to any of these, your site needs <a href="/blog/website-losing-customers.html">immediate attention</a>.</p>

        <h2>Mistake #5: No Local Content</h2>

        <p>Your website says "we serve the local area" but never mentions a specific city, neighborhood, or landmark. Google can't rank you for "HVAC repair <a href="/seo-concord-nh.html">Concord NH</a>" if those words don't appear anywhere on your site.</p>

        <p><strong>What to do instead:</strong> Create dedicated pages for each city you serve. Mention local landmarks, neighborhoods, and zip codes naturally in your content. Write blog posts about local topics. A <a href="/seo-dover-nh.html">Dover</a> roofer writing about "preparing your Dover NH home for winter" signals strong local relevance to Google.</p>

        <h2>Mistake #6: Buying Cheap Backlinks</h2>

        <p>Someone on Fiverr promised you "1,000 backlinks for $50." You thought that sounded like a great deal. It wasn't.</p>

        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Spammy backlinks from link farms, blog comment spam, and private blog networks (PBNs) can trigger a Google penalty. We've seen local businesses completely disappear from search results after buying cheap links.</p>

        <p><strong>What to do instead:</strong> Earn real backlinks from local sources: your Chamber of Commerce, local news sites, business directories, and partners. One link from the NH Business Review is worth more than 10,000 spam links. Quality over quantity, every time.</p>

        <h2>Mistake #7: Forgetting About Page Speed</h2>

        <p>Your website loads in 8 seconds. You think that's fine because it looks nice once it finally loads. Your visitors disagree — 53% of mobile users leave a site that takes over 3 seconds to load.</p>

        <p><strong>What to do instead:</strong> Compress your images (most sites we audit have unoptimized 5MB photos). Enable browser caching. Minimize plugins. Use a content delivery network (CDN). Google's PageSpeed Insights tool is free — run your site through it today.</p>

        <h2>Mistake #8: Not Tracking Anything</h2>

        <p>You "did SEO" for three months but have no idea if it worked. No Google Analytics. No Search Console. No rank tracking. You're flying blind.</p>

        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without data, you can't tell what's working and what's wasting your time. You might be ranking #11 for a valuable keyword — one small fix away from page 1 — and you'd never know.</p>

        <p><strong>What to do instead:</strong> At minimum, set up Google Analytics 4 and Google Search Console. Both are free. Search Console shows you exactly what keywords people use to find your site and where you rank. Check it monthly at minimum.</p>

        <h2>Mistake #9: Expecting Overnight Results</h2>

        <p>You made some changes last Tuesday and checked your rankings on Thursday. Nothing changed. So you decided "SEO doesn't work" and gave up.</p>

        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> SEO is a compounding investment, not a light switch. Most businesses see meaningful results in <a href="/blog/how-long-seo-takes.html">3-6 months</a>. The businesses that win are the ones that stay consistent.</p>

        <p><strong>What to do instead:</strong> Set realistic expectations. Month 1 is about fixing foundations. Month 2-3 is content and optimization. Months 4-6 is when rankings start climbing. Read our <a href="/blog/how-long-seo-takes.html">realistic SEO timeline</a> so you know exactly what to expect each month.</p>

        <h2>Mistake #10: Trying to Do Everything at Once</h2>

        <p>You read 15 blog posts (including ours), watched 10 YouTube videos, and now you have a list of 200 things to fix. So you try to do everything simultaneously, do none of it well, and burn out in two weeks.</p>

        <p><strong>What to do instead:</strong> Prioritize ruthlessly. Start with the highest-impact items: Google Business Profile, title tags, and mobile friendliness. Then work down the list systematically. If you're not sure where to start, our <a href="/free-audit.html">free SEO audit</a> shows you exactly what to fix first, ranked by impact.</p>

        <h2>The Real Cost of DIY SEO Mistakes</h2>

        <p>Here's what these mistakes actually cost you:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lost time</strong> — hours spent on tactics that don't move the needle</li>
            <li><strong>Lost rankings</strong> — keyword stuffing and spam links can actively hurt you</li>
            <li><strong>Lost customers</strong> — every month your competitors rank above you, they're getting calls that should be yours</li>
            <li><strong>Lost money</strong> — <a href="/blog/seo-cost-nh-small-business.html">professional SEO costs less</a> than the revenue you lose from doing it wrong</li>
        </ul>

        <p>A <a href="/seo-portsmouth-nh.html">Portsmouth</a> restaurant owner we spoke with spent 8 months doing DIY SEO. When we audited their site, they had duplicate title tags on every page, zero Google Business Profile optimization, and 14 broken links. Eight months of effort, and they were actually ranking <em>lower</em> than when they started.</p>

        <h2>When DIY SEO Makes Sense (And When It Doesn't)</h2>

        <p>To be fair, there are things you absolutely can and should do yourself:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Claim and update your Google Business Profile</li>
            <li>Respond to every Google review</li>
            <li>Write genuine, helpful content about your expertise</li>
            <li>Make sure your name, address, and phone number are consistent everywhere</li>
            <li>Ask happy customers for <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">Google reviews</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>But when it comes to technical SEO, site architecture, link building strategy, and competitive keyword targeting — that's where <a href="/blog/how-to-choose-seo-agency-nh.html">working with an experienced agency</a> saves you time, money, and frustration.</p>
