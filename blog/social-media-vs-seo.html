        <p>"We already post on Facebook and Instagram — do we really need SEO too?"</p>

        <p>We hear this from NH business owners every week. It's a fair question. You're already investing time (and maybe money) into social media. Why add another channel?</p>

        <p>Here's the short answer: <strong>social media and SEO do completely different things.</strong> One builds your brand. The other captures customers who are already looking for what you sell. If you can only pick one, the data overwhelmingly favors SEO for local businesses. Let's break down why.</p>

        <h2>The Fundamental Difference</h2>

        <p><strong>Social media is push marketing.</strong> You create content and push it out to people who may or may not care. You're competing with vacation photos, memes, and news headlines for 2 seconds of someone's attention. Most of your followers aren't ready to buy anything right now.</p>

        <p><strong>SEO is pull marketing.</strong> Someone in <a href="/seo-manchester-nh.html">Manchester, NH</a> types "emergency plumber near me" into Google. They have a flooded basement. They need help <em>right now</em>. If you rank #1, you get the call. That's a customer with their wallet open, actively looking for you.</p>

        <p>This is the critical distinction most business owners miss. Social media reaches people who <em>might</em> need you someday. SEO reaches people who need you <em>today</em>.</p>

        <h2>The Numbers: Social Media vs SEO</h2>

        <p>Let's compare with real data:</p>

        <h3>Organic Reach on Social Media</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Average Facebook organic reach: <strong>2-5% of followers</strong> (and dropping every year)</li>
            <li>Average Instagram organic reach: <strong>7-10% of followers</strong></li>
            <li>A local business with 500 Facebook followers reaches about 15-25 people per post</li>
            <li>Those people are scrolling mindlessly — they're not looking for your service</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Organic Search (SEO)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"Plumber Manchester NH" gets <strong>~200 searches/month</strong></li>
            <li>The #1 Google result gets <strong>~27% of all clicks</strong></li>
            <li>That's ~54 clicks/month from people <em>actively searching</em> for a plumber</li>
            <li>These are high-intent visitors — they convert at 3-8x the rate of social media visitors</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Now multiply that across every keyword variation: "plumber near me," "emergency plumbing Nashua," "water heater repair NH." A well-optimized local business captures hundreds of high-intent visits per month.</p>

        <h2>ROI Comparison</h2>

        <p>We analyzed the marketing spend of 20 NH small businesses across both channels. Here's what we found:</p>

        <h3>Social Media</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time investment:</strong> 5-10 hours/week creating content, responding, scheduling</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> $0-500/month (organic) or $500-2,000/month (paid ads)</li>
            <li><strong>Average customer acquisition cost:</strong> $50-150 per lead</li>
            <li><strong>Lead quality:</strong> Mixed — many window shoppers and price comparers</li>
            <li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> A Facebook post reaches most of its audience within 5 hours</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>SEO</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time investment:</strong> Minimal after setup (agency handles it)</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> <a href="/blog/seo-cost-nh-small-business.html">$500-2,500/month</a> for professional SEO</li>
            <li><strong>Average customer acquisition cost:</strong> $15-40 per lead (after month 6)</li>
            <li><strong>Lead quality:</strong> High — these people searched for your exact service</li>
            <li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> A well-ranked page generates traffic for months or years</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The compounding effect is what makes SEO so powerful. Social media is a treadmill — stop posting and the traffic stops. SEO is an investment — the work you do in month 3 still generates leads in month 12, month 24, and beyond. We cover this compounding effect in detail in our <a href="/blog/how-long-seo-takes.html">SEO timeline guide</a>.</p>

        <h2>When Social Media Actually Makes Sense</h2>

        <p>We're not saying social media is worthless. It excels in specific scenarios:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brand awareness:</strong> People need to see your name 7+ times before they remember it. Social helps with that.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual businesses:</strong> Restaurants, salons, and home renovators can show off their work. A before/after photo of a <a href="/seo-portsmouth-nh.html">Portsmouth</a> kitchen remodel is worth a thousand words.</li>
            <li><strong>Community building:</strong> If your business thrives on personal relationships (real estate agents, fitness studios), social helps build trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotions and events:</strong> Flash sales, seasonal specials, and local events get good engagement.</li>
            <li><strong>Review amplification:</strong> Sharing positive <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">Google reviews</a> on social media extends their reach.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But notice something: none of these drive direct, immediate customer acquisition for service businesses. Nobody is scrolling Facebook thinking "I should hire a roofer today."</p>

        <h2>When SEO Is the Clear Winner</h2>

        <p>SEO dominates for local service businesses because of one simple fact: <strong>people search Google when they need something.</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Emergency services:</strong> Plumbing, HVAC, locksmiths, towing — nobody searches Facebook for these</li>
            <li><strong>High-consideration purchases:</strong> Dental work, legal services, home remodeling — people research on Google</li>
            <li><strong>Location-dependent services:</strong> Any "near me" search goes through Google Maps and search</li>
            <li><strong>Repeat/referral businesses:</strong> People Google your business name even when referred by a friend</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you're a service business in <a href="/seo-nashua-nh.html">Nashua</a>, <a href="/seo-concord-nh.html">Concord</a>, or anywhere in New Hampshire, the question isn't whether you need SEO. It's <a href="/blog/why-nh-business-not-on-google.html">why you're not already doing it</a>.</p>

        <h2>The Smart Strategy: SEO First, Social Second</h2>

        <p>Here's our recommendation for NH small businesses with limited marketing budgets:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Fix your Google foundation first.</strong> Claim and optimize your <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-tips.html">Google Business Profile</a>. Fix your website's basic SEO. Get into local directories. This alone can double your inbound leads within 6 months.</li>
            <li><strong>Invest in local SEO consistently.</strong> Our <a href="/blog/local-seo-guide-nh.html">local SEO guide</a> covers the full strategy. It's not glamorous, but it's the highest-ROI marketing channel for local businesses, period.</li>
            <li><strong>Add social media as a supplement.</strong> Once your SEO foundation is solid, use social media to amplify your brand. Share your blog posts. Post customer success stories. Show behind-the-scenes content. But don't let it eat time that should go toward SEO.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Think of it this way: SEO is your 24/7 salesperson who works while you sleep. Social media is your PR team that keeps your name in the conversation. You need the salesperson before you need the PR team.</p>

        <h2>Common Objections (And Our Honest Answers)</h2>

        <h3>"But my competitor has 5,000 Facebook followers!"</h3>
        <p>Ask how many customers those followers actually generated last month. Followers are a vanity metric. Google rankings are a revenue metric. We'd rather help a business rank #1 for 10 local keywords than have 10,000 followers who never buy.</p>

        <h3>"Social media is free, SEO costs money."</h3>
        <p>Social media isn't free — it costs your time. If you spend 8 hours a week on social media, that's time you're not spending running your business. And organic reach is approaching zero without paid promotion. Meanwhile, professional SEO <a href="/blog/seo-cost-nh-small-business.html">costs less than you think</a> and compounds over time.</p>

        <h3>"I tried SEO before and it didn't work."</h3>
        <p>That usually means one of three things: the agency used outdated tactics, you didn't give it enough time, or the strategy wasn't focused on local keywords. Our <a href="/blog/how-to-choose-seo-agency-nh.html">guide to choosing an SEO agency</a> helps you avoid these mistakes. And our <a href="/blog/diy-seo-mistakes.html">DIY SEO mistakes article</a> covers the most common pitfalls if you've been trying it yourself.</p>

        <h2>Real Example: A Keene Restaurant</h2>

        <p>A restaurant owner in <a href="/seo-keene-nh.html">Keene</a> came to us spending $800/month on Instagram ads and 10 hours/week creating content. They had 3,200 followers but couldn't trace a single reservation back to social media.</p>

        <p>We redirected $600/month to local SEO and <a href="/blog/google-maps-ranking-nh.html">Google Maps optimization</a>. Within 4 months:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ranked #1 for "Italian restaurant Keene NH" and 12 related keywords</li>
            <li>Google Maps profile views up 340%</li>
            <li>Direction requests up 210%</li>
            <li>22 new reservations tracked directly from Google per month</li>
        </ul>

        <p>They still post on Instagram — but now it's 2 hours/week instead of 10, and it supplements their SEO rather than replacing it.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>For NH small businesses, especially service businesses:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>SEO captures demand.</strong> People are already searching for what you offer. SEO puts you in front of them.</li>
            <li><strong>Social media creates awareness.</strong> Important, but less urgent than capturing existing demand.</li>
            <li><strong>SEO compounds.</strong> Every month's work builds on the last. Social media requires constant feeding.</li>
            <li><strong>SEO delivers higher ROI.</strong> Lower cost per lead, higher intent, better conversion rates.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you're currently putting all your marketing budget into social media and getting inconsistent results, it might be time to reconsider. A free SEO audit can show you exactly how much search traffic you're leaving on the table.</p>
