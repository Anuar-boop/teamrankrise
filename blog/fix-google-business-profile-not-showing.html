    <div class="container" style="max-width:780px;">
        <div class="reveal">
            <p class="intro-text">You created your Google Business Profile. You filled out every field. You waited. And nothing. Your business still doesn't show up when people search for what you do in your area. It is one of the most frustrating problems in local SEO — and it is more common than you think.</p>

            <p>The good news: there is always a reason. Google does not randomly hide businesses. Something specific is preventing your profile from appearing in search results, the Local Pack, or Google Maps. This guide walks through the 12 most common causes and the exact steps to fix each one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>1. Your Profile Is Not Verified</h2>

            <p>This is the number one reason new profiles do not show up. Google requires verification before displaying your business in search results. Without it, your profile essentially does not exist to searchers.</p>

            <h3>How to Check</h3>
            <p>Log into your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a> dashboard. Look for a "Verified" badge or a pending verification notice. If you see "Verify now" or "Verification pending," that is your problem.</p>

            <h3>How to Fix</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Postcard verification</strong> — Google mails a postcard with a PIN to your business address. Takes 5-14 days. Do not change your business name or address while waiting.</li>
                <li><strong>Phone verification</strong> — Available for some businesses. You receive an automated call or text with a code.</li>
                <li><strong>Email verification</strong> — Less common, but Google may offer it for established businesses with a visible web presence.</li>
                <li><strong>Video verification</strong> — Google now offers video calls where you show your business location and signage to a support rep.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If your postcard never arrives, request a new one. Do not wait more than 14 days. If multiple postcards fail, contact Google Business Profile support directly and ask for an alternative verification method.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>2. Your Profile Was Suspended</h2>

            <p>Google suspends profiles that violate their guidelines — and sometimes they get it wrong. A suspended profile is invisible to everyone except you.</p>

            <h3>Common Suspension Triggers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a virtual office, PO Box, or coworking space address (without meeting customers at that location)</li>
                <li>Stuffing keywords into your business name ("John's Plumbing — Best Plumber in Manchester NH")</li>
                <li>Operating from a residential address without proper setup</li>
                <li>Having duplicate listings for the same business</li>
                <li>Suspected fake reviews or review manipulation</li>
                <li>Frequent major edits to the profile (name, address, category changes)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Fix</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Check your GBP dashboard for a suspension notice</li>
                <li>Fix any guideline violations (remove keyword stuffing from name, update address)</li>
                <li>Submit a reinstatement request through the GBP support form</li>
                <li>Provide supporting documentation: business license, utility bill, lease agreement, signage photos</li>
                <li>Wait 3-7 business days for review. Follow up if no response.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>3. Your Business Is Too New</h2>

            <p>Brand new Google Business Profiles often take time to appear in search results. Google needs to build trust in your listing before showing it to searchers.</p>

            <h3>What to Expect</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 1-2</strong> — Profile may not appear in any searches</li>
                <li><strong>Week 2-4</strong> — Profile starts appearing for direct (branded) searches</li>
                <li><strong>Month 1-3</strong> — Profile gradually appears for category and keyword searches</li>
                <li><strong>Month 3-6</strong> — Full visibility (depending on competition and optimization)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Speed It Up</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete every single field in your profile — aim for 100% completion</li>
                <li>Add 20+ high-quality photos immediately</li>
                <li>Post weekly using <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-posts.html">Google Business Profile posts</a></li>
                <li>Get your first 5-10 reviews as quickly as possible</li>
                <li>Build <a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">citations</a> on major directories (Yelp, BBB, Yellow Pages, industry directories)</li>
                <li>Make sure your website links to your GBP and vice versa</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>4. Wrong or Missing Categories</h2>

            <p>Your <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-categories-guide.html">primary category</a> is the single biggest ranking factor for your GBP. If it is wrong, you will not show up for the right searches.</p>

            <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Choosing a category that is too broad ("Business" instead of "Plumbing Service")</li>
                <li>Choosing a category that does not match your core service</li>
                <li>Not adding relevant secondary categories</li>
                <li>Using a category that Google does not offer (you can only pick from their predefined list)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Fix</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Search for your top competitor who ranks in the Local Pack</li>
                <li>Use a tool like GMB Everywhere or PlePer to see what categories they use</li>
                <li>Set your primary category to the most specific option that describes your main service</li>
                <li>Add 3-5 secondary categories for other services you offer</li>
            </ol>
            <p>"Plumber" is better than "Home Service." "Emergency Plumber" might be even better if that is your specialty. Specificity wins.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>5. Address and Service Area Problems</h2>

            <p>Google determines which businesses to show based on proximity to the searcher. If your address is wrong or your service area is misconfigured, you will be invisible to nearby customers.</p>

            <h3>Storefront Businesses</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your address must be your actual physical location where customers visit</li>
                <li>The address must match your website, citations, and all other online listings (<a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">NAP consistency</a>)</li>
                <li>Suite numbers, floor numbers, and unit numbers must be consistent everywhere</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Service-Area Businesses</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you go to customers (plumber, electrician, locksmith), set up service areas instead of displaying your address</li>
                <li>Do not set your service area too large — Google penalizes unrealistically wide coverage areas</li>
                <li>Choose specific cities, counties, or zip codes you actually serve</li>
                <li>Read our <a href="/blog/local-seo-for-service-area-businesses.html">service-area business guide</a> for a full walkthrough</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>6. Duplicate Listings</h2>

            <p>If Google finds two or more profiles for the same business at the same address, it may suppress all of them. Duplicate listings confuse the algorithm and split your reviews and ranking signals.</p>

            <h3>How Duplicates Happen</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A previous owner created a listing at the same address</li>
                <li>An employee or agency created a second profile by accident</li>
                <li>Google auto-generated a listing from web data</li>
                <li>You moved locations and did not properly close the old listing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Fix</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Search Google Maps for your business name and address</li>
                <li>Search for your business category plus your address to find auto-generated listings</li>
                <li>If you find duplicates, claim them (if unclaimed) and then mark them as permanently closed or request removal</li>
                <li>Use the "Suggest an edit" feature on Maps to flag duplicates you cannot claim</li>
                <li>Contact GBP support if duplicates persist after your own efforts</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>7. Guideline Violations in Your Business Name</h2>

            <p>Your GBP business name must match your real-world business name — exactly. Adding keywords, locations, or marketing taglines is a guideline violation that can suppress your profile.</p>

            <h3>Violations</h3>
            <div class="table-wrapper">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Wrong (Violation)</th>
                            <th>Correct</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>Joe's Plumbing - Best Plumber Manchester NH</td><td>Joe's Plumbing</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>ABC Law Firm | Personal Injury Lawyers</td><td>ABC Law Firm</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Main Street Dental - Affordable Dentist</td><td>Main Street Dental</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Premium Auto Repair &amp; Tire Shop 24/7</td><td>Premium Auto Repair</td></tr>

                </table>
            </div>
            <p>Your business name should match what is on your signage, business cards, and legal documents. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>8. Your Website Has Major SEO Issues</h2>

            <p>Google uses your website as a trust signal for your GBP. If your site has serious problems, it drags down your profile visibility too.</p>

            <h3>Website Issues That Hurt GBP Visibility</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No website linked</strong> — Profiles without a website rank significantly lower</li>
                <li><strong>Website is down or returns errors</strong> — Google cannot verify your business if your site is broken</li>
                <li><strong>No local content</strong> — Your site does not mention your city, state, or service areas</li>
                <li><strong>No <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">schema markup</a></strong> — LocalBusiness schema helps Google connect your site to your GBP</li>
                <li><strong>Poor <a href="/blog/website-speed-optimization.html">site speed</a></strong> — Slow-loading sites signal low quality</li>
                <li><strong>Not mobile-friendly</strong> — Most local searches happen on phones</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Quick Fixes</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure your website loads and does not return 404 or 500 errors</li>
                <li>Add your business name, address, and phone number to your site footer</li>
                <li>Add LocalBusiness schema markup to your homepage</li>
                <li>Create location-specific content mentioning the cities you serve</li>
                <li>Link from your website to your GBP (and vice versa)</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>9. You Are in a Highly Competitive Market</h2>

            <p>The <a href="/blog/google-local-pack-ranking.html">Local Pack</a> only shows 3 results. If you are in a competitive industry (lawyers, dentists, plumbers, restaurants) in a populated area, you might be ranking — just not in the top 3.</p>

            <h3>How to Check</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Search for your main keyword on Google Maps (not regular search)</li>
                <li>Scroll past the top 3 results — you might be position 4, 5, or 10</li>
                <li>Use a local rank tracker to check your position from different locations within your service area</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Improve</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>More reviews</strong> — Businesses in the Local Pack typically have 2-5x more reviews than those ranked below</li>
                <li><strong>Better reviews</strong> — Higher ratings and reviews that mention specific services help</li>
                <li><strong>More citations</strong> — <a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">Build citations</a> on industry-specific directories</li>
                <li><strong>Better on-page SEO</strong> — Optimize your <a href="/blog/service-pages-that-rank-convert.html">service pages</a> for local keywords</li>
                <li><strong>Backlinks</strong> — <a href="/blog/local-link-building-strategies.html">Local link building</a> boosts both your website and GBP rankings</li>
                <li><strong>Engagement signals</strong> — Regular posts, Q&A responses, and photo uploads show an active business</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>10. NAP Inconsistencies Across the Web</h2>

            <p>NAP stands for Name, Address, Phone number. If these details do not match exactly across your website, GBP, social profiles, and directory listings, Google loses confidence in your business data.</p>

            <h3>Common Inconsistencies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"123 Main St" vs "123 Main Street" vs "123 Main St."</li>
                <li>Different phone numbers on different platforms</li>
                <li>Old address on directories you forgot about</li>
                <li>Business name variations ("Joe's Auto" vs "Joe's Auto Repair" vs "Joe's Auto Repair LLC")</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Fix</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pick one exact format for your business name, address, and phone number</li>
                <li>Update your website, GBP, social profiles, and all major directories to match</li>
                <li>Search Google for your old phone number or old address to find forgotten listings</li>
                <li>Use a citation audit tool to find inconsistencies across the web</li>

            <h2>11. Google Is Testing or Filtering Your Listing</h2>

            <p>Sometimes your profile disappears temporarily due to Google's own processes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Algorithm updates</strong> — <a href="/blog/google-algorithm-updates-2026.html">Google updates</a> can temporarily shuffle local results</li>
                <li><strong>Spam filters</strong> — Automated systems may flag legitimate businesses by mistake</li>
                <li><strong>Data refreshes</strong> — Google periodically reprocesses GBP data, causing temporary fluctuations</li>
                <li><strong>Review removal</strong> — If Google removes a batch of reviews it considers fake, your ranking can drop</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What to Do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Wait 1-2 weeks — many temporary drops resolve themselves</li>
                <li>Check local SEO community forums (Local Search Forum, SEO subreddits) to see if others report similar issues</li>
                <li>If the problem persists beyond 2 weeks, contact GBP support</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>12. You Are Searching Wrong</h2>

            <p>This sounds obvious, but it is surprisingly common. The way you search affects what results you see.</p>

            <h3>Why Your Own Searches Are Misleading</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalization</strong> — Google shows different results based on your search history</li>
                <li><strong>Location</strong> — Results change based on your exact GPS location, not just your city</li>
                <li><strong>Device</strong> — Desktop and mobile results are different</li>
                <li><strong>Incognito is not enough</strong> — Even incognito mode uses your IP address for location</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Properly Check Your Rankings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a local rank tracking tool that checks from multiple points within your service area</li>
                <li>Ask friends and customers in different locations to search and send you screenshots</li>
                <li>Use <a href="/blog/google-search-console-local-seo.html">Google Search Console</a> to see which queries your site appears for</li>
                <li>Check GBP Insights for actual impression and action data</li>

            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>A Google Business Profile that does not show up is a business that is invisible to local customers. Every day your profile is hidden, your competitors are getting the calls, clicks, and visits that should be yours.</p>

            <p>Start with the basics: verification, business name compliance, correct categories, and NAP consistency. These four items alone resolve about 80% of visibility problems. Then work through the rest of this checklist systematically.</p>

            <p>If you have been waiting weeks with no improvement, do not keep guessing. A professional <a href="/services.html#gbp">GBP audit</a> can pinpoint the exact issue in minutes and save you months of frustration.</p>
