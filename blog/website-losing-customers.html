    <p>Your website might look fine to you. Maybe you had it built a few years ago, it loads okay on your laptop, and the phone number is right there on the homepage.</p>

    <p>But here's the uncomfortable truth: <strong>your website could be silently turning away dozens of potential customers every month</strong> — and you'd never know it.</p>

    <p>There's no notification that says "a customer in <a href="/seo-manchester-nh.html">Manchester</a> searched for your service, found your site, and left because it took 6 seconds to load." They just... leave. And go to your competitor instead.</p>

    <p>After auditing hundreds of small business websites across New Hampshire, here are the 5 most common problems we see — and exactly how to fix each one.</p>

    <h2>1. Your Site Doesn't Show Up on Google</h2>

    <p>This is the biggest one. If you Google your business name and it shows up — great. But that's not the test that matters.</p>

    <p>The test that matters is: <strong>what happens when someone searches for what you do?</strong></p>

    <p>Try this right now:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Open Google in an incognito/private window</li>
        <li>Search for "[your service] [your city]" (e.g., "plumber Nashua NH" or "dentist Concord NH")</li>
        <li>Look at the first page of results and the Map Pack (the map with 3 businesses)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you're not there, you're invisible to the vast majority of potential customers. <strong>68% of online experiences start with a search engine</strong>, and 75% of people never scroll past page 1.</p>

    <h3>Why This Happens</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No SEO strategy</strong> — your site was built to look nice, not to rank</li>
        <li><strong>Missing meta descriptions and title tags</strong> — Google doesn't know what your pages are about</li>
        <li><strong>No structured data</strong> — Google can't verify your business details for <a href="/blog/google-maps-ranking-nh.html">Map Pack results</a></li>
        <li><strong>Thin content</strong> — not enough text for Google to understand your expertise</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
    <p>Start with the basics: make sure every page has a unique title tag (under 60 characters) that includes your service and city. Add a meta description (under 160 characters) that tells searchers exactly what you offer. If you haven't claimed and optimized your <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-tips.html">Google Business Profile</a>, do that today — it's free and it's the single fastest way to appear in local search results.</p>

    <h2>2. Your Website Is Slow (Especially on Mobile)</h2>

    <p>Here's a stat that should worry you: <strong>53% of mobile visitors leave a site that takes longer than 3 seconds to load</strong>. Three seconds.</p>

    <p>Most small business websites we audit in NH take 5-8 seconds to load on mobile. That means over half of your potential customers are gone before they see a single word on your site.</p>

    <h3>Common Speed Killers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Uncompressed images</strong> — a single hero image can be 3-5MB when it should be 200KB</li>
        <li><strong>Too many plugins</strong> — WordPress sites with 30+ plugins are painfully slow</li>
        <li><strong>No caching</strong> — your server rebuilds the page from scratch for every visitor</li>
        <li><strong>Cheap hosting</strong> — shared hosting with hundreds of other sites on the same server</li>
        <li><strong>Render-blocking resources</strong> — CSS and JavaScript files that prevent the page from displaying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
    <p>Test your site speed at <strong>Google PageSpeed Insights</strong> (pagespeed.web.dev). It's free and tells you exactly what's slowing you down. The quick wins: compress your images (use WebP format), enable browser caching, and remove any plugins you're not actively using. If your site scores below 50 on mobile, speed optimization should be your #1 priority.</p>

    <h2>3. Your Site Isn't Mobile-Friendly</h2>

    <p>In 2026, <strong>over 60% of Google searches come from mobile devices</strong>. For local searches like "restaurant near me" or "emergency plumber," that number is even higher — closer to 80%.</p>

    <p>Google uses "mobile-first indexing," which means it primarily looks at the mobile version of your site to determine rankings. If your site doesn't work well on a phone, Google pushes you down in search results — even for people searching on desktops.</p>

    <h3>Signs Your Site Isn't Mobile-Friendly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Text is too small to read without pinching and zooming</li>
        <li>Buttons and links are too close together to tap accurately</li>
        <li>The page requires horizontal scrolling</li>
        <li>Navigation menu doesn't work on phones (no hamburger menu)</li>
        <li>Forms are impossible to fill out on a small screen</li>
        <li>Missing the viewport meta tag entirely</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
    <p>Pull out your phone right now and visit your own website. Try to do what a customer would do: find your phone number, read about your services, fill out a contact form. If any of that is frustrating, your customers feel the same way. A responsive redesign is the fix — the site should automatically adapt to any screen size. Every page needs a <code>&lt;meta name="viewport"&gt;</code> tag, and touch targets should be at least 48x48 pixels.</p>

    <h2>4. You Have No Clear Call-to-Action</h2>

    <p>Imagine a customer finds your site. They're interested. They want to hire you. Now what?</p>

    <p>On too many small business websites, the answer is "hunt around and hope you find a phone number or contact form." That's not good enough. <strong>Every page on your website should make it obvious what the visitor should do next.</strong></p>

    <h3>What We See on Struggling Sites</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Phone number buried in the footer (or missing entirely)</li>
        <li>No contact form — just a "mailto:" link that opens their email app</li>
        <li>Contact page that's 3 clicks deep in the navigation</li>
        <li>"Contact Us" is the only call-to-action (too generic, no urgency)</li>
        <li>No value proposition — why should they choose YOU over the next result?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
    <p>Put your phone number in the top navigation — clickable on mobile. Add a strong call-to-action button above the fold on every page. Use specific language: not "Contact Us" but "Get Your Free Estimate" or "Book an Appointment Today." And make sure your contact form is short — name, email, phone, and a message field. Nothing more. Every extra field you add reduces form completions by about 10%.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Content Is Outdated or Missing</h2>

    <p>When was the last time you updated your website? If you have a copyright date of 2022 in the footer, visitors assume you might be out of business. If your blog's last post was from 2023, Google assumes your site is stale.</p>

    <p><strong>Fresh, relevant content is one of the strongest signals Google uses to rank websites.</strong> Businesses that blog regularly get 55% more website visitors than those that don't.</p>

    <h3>Content Red Flags</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Homepage hasn't been updated in over a year</li>
        <li>Services page lists things you no longer offer (or doesn't list new ones)</li>
        <li>No blog or resource section at all</li>
        <li>Pages with only 50-100 words of text (Google considers this "thin content")</li>
        <li>Stock photos from 2015 that look nothing like your actual business</li>
        <li>No mention of your city, town, or service area</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Fix It</h3>
    <p>Update your copyright year (small but matters). Make sure every service you offer has its own page with at least 500 words of unique content. Start a blog — even one post per month makes a difference. Write about topics your customers actually ask about. A <a href="/seo-nashua-nh.html">Nashua plumber</a> could write about "How to Prevent Frozen Pipes in NH Winters." A <a href="/seo-portsmouth-nh.html">Portsmouth restaurant</a> could write about "Best Seasonal Ingredients from New Hampshire Farms." This kind of content builds topical authority and brings in search traffic for months or years.</p>

    <h2>The Cost of Doing Nothing</h2>

    <p>These aren't just theoretical problems. They have a real dollar cost. Let's do some quick math:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Say 500 people per month search for your service in your area</li>
        <li>If you're not on page 1, you get roughly 0% of those clicks</li>
        <li>Even a modest 10% click-through rate would bring 50 visitors/month</li>
        <li>If 5% of those visitors become customers, that's 2-3 new customers per month</li>
        <li>For most service businesses, each customer is worth $200-$2,000+</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>That's $400 to $6,000+ in revenue you're leaving on the table every single month.</strong> Over a year, fixing your website could mean the difference between struggling and thriving.</p>

    <h2>How to Check Your Own Site (Free)</h2>

    <p>Want to know exactly where your website stands? Here are free tools anyone can use:</p>

    <h2>Which Fix Should You Prioritize?</h2>

    <p>If you're dealing with multiple issues (most businesses are), here's the order we recommend:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mobile-friendliness</strong> — this affects everything else</li>
        <li><strong>Page speed</strong> — slow sites lose visitors before they see your content</li>
        <li><strong>Google Business Profile</strong> — free, and delivers fast results for local search</li>
        <li><strong>On-page SEO</strong> — title tags, meta descriptions, <a href="/blog/website-seo-checklist.html">structured data</a></li>
        <li><strong>Content</strong> — <a href="/blog/local-seo-guide-nh.html">ongoing optimization</a> that compounds over time</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The businesses that fix these issues see results within 60-90 days — sometimes sooner. The ones that wait fall further behind every month as competitors invest in their online presence.</p>
