    <div class="container blog-content reveal">

        <p>If you search "content marketing" online, you'll find advice about viral blog posts, thought leadership, and building massive email lists. None of it applies to a plumber in <a href="/seo-manchester-nh.html">Manchester</a> or a dentist in <a href="/seo-nashua-nh.html">Nashua</a>.</p>

        <p>Content marketing for local businesses is fundamentally different from content marketing for SaaS companies or national brands. Your goal isn't to go viral — it's to show up when someone in your area searches for what you do.</p>

        <p>Here's what actually moves the needle for NH local businesses.</p>

        <h2>The 3 Types of Content That Matter for Local SEO</h2>

        <h3>1. Service Pages (Most Important)</h3>

        <p>Before you write a single blog post, your service pages need to be dialed in. Each service you offer should have its own dedicated page — not a bullet point on a generic "Services" page.</p>

        <p>A plumber should have separate pages for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emergency Plumbing Services</li>
            <li>Water Heater Repair & Installation</li>
            <li>Drain Cleaning</li>
            <li>Bathroom Remodeling</li>
            <li>Sump Pump Installation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each page should answer the questions someone asking about that service would have: what's included, how long it takes, what it costs (ranges are fine), what area you serve, and why they should choose you.</p>

        <p>This isn't "content marketing" in the traditional sense, but it's the highest-ROI content you'll ever create. Every one of these pages can rank for its own set of keywords.</p>

        <h3>2. Location Pages</h3>

        <p>If you serve multiple cities in NH, you need a page for each one. Not duplicate content with the city name swapped — genuinely localized content that mentions neighborhoods, landmarks, and local context.</p>

        <p>We've built location pages for cities like <a href="/seo-concord-nh.html">Concord</a>, <a href="/seo-dover-nh.html">Dover</a>, <a href="/seo-portsmouth-nh.html">Portsmouth</a>, and <a href="/seo-keene-nh.html">Keene</a>. Each one ranks for "[service] + [city]" searches — which are exactly the searches that turn into customers.</p>

        <p>A good location page includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mention of the city in the title, H1, and meta description</li>
            <li>Local context (neighborhoods, zip codes, nearby landmarks)</li>
            <li>Why you serve that area / how long you've been there</li>
            <li>Reviews or testimonials from customers in that city</li>
            <li>Embedded Google Map showing your service area</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Blog Posts (Supporting Content)</h3>

        <p>Blog posts are the third priority — not the first. They support your service and location pages by building topical authority and targeting long-tail keywords.</p>

        <p>The best blog posts for local businesses answer questions your customers actually ask:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>"How much does [service] cost in NH?"</li>
            <li>"How to choose a [service provider] in [city]"</li>
            <li>"Signs you need [service]"</li>
            <li>"DIY vs professional [service]: what to know"</li>
            <li>"[Service] tips for New Hampshire homeowners" (seasonal angle)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Notice the pattern: every topic has a local angle and connects to a service you offer. Generic posts like "5 Fun Things to Do This Weekend" don't help your SEO unless you're a tourism business.</p>

        <h2>What NOT to Write About</h2>

        <p>We see NH businesses waste time on content that doesn't move rankings:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Meet Our Team" blog posts</strong> — nice for your About page, useless for SEO</li>
            <li><strong>Industry news nobody searches for</strong> — "New EPA Regulation Affects HVAC Systems" isn't what your customers search</li>
            <li><strong>Content that doesn't mention your area</strong> — a generic "How to Fix a Leaky Faucet" guide competes with national sites. "How NH Homeowners Can Handle Winter Pipe Leaks" is much more winnable</li>
            <li><strong>Content that doesn't connect to your services</strong> — a restaurant blogging about nutrition science isn't going to drive reservations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Every piece of content should serve one of two purposes: rank for a keyword that leads to a customer, or internally link to a service/location page that does.</p>

        <h2>The Content Calendar That Actually Works</h2>

        <p>Forget weekly blog posts. For most local businesses, here's a realistic and effective schedule:</p>

        <h3>Month 1-2: Foundation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Write/rewrite all service pages (one per service)</li>
            <li>Create location pages for your top 3-5 cities</li>
            <li>Optimize your <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-tips.html">Google Business Profile</a> description</li>
            <li>Write your About page with local context and keywords</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Month 3-6: Growth</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Publish 2 blog posts per month targeting customer questions</li>
            <li>Add internal links from blog posts to service and location pages</li>
            <li>Create a FAQ page targeting common questions</li>
            <li>Expand location pages to cover secondary service areas</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Month 6+: Authority</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain 1-2 blog posts per month</li>
            <li>Update older content with new information</li>
            <li>Create comparison content ("Our approach vs. [alternative]")</li>
            <li>Build <a href="/blog/backlinks-local-seo-nh.html">local backlinks</a> to your best content</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This approach generates more results than publishing 52 mediocre posts a year because each piece of content is strategic and purposeful.</p>

        <h2>How to Find the Right Topics</h2>

        <p>The best topic ideas come from your customers, not keyword tools:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Check Google's "People Also Ask"</strong> — search your main service + city and expand the "People Also Ask" boxes. These are real questions real people search</li>
            <li><strong>Review your emails and calls</strong> — what do customers ask before hiring you? Each question is a potential blog post</li>
            <li><strong>Look at competitor blogs</strong> — what are other NH businesses in your industry writing about?</li>
            <li><strong>Check Google Search Console</strong> — see what searches are already bringing people to your site, then create content to better serve those queries. If you haven't set this up yet, read our guide on <a href="/blog/why-nh-business-not-on-google.html">getting your business on Google</a></li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal angles</strong> — NH businesses have a huge advantage here. Winter prep, spring cleanup, summer maintenance, fall preparation — these seasonal topics repeat annually and always get searches</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Internal Linking Strategy (Critical)</h2>

        <p>Creating content is only half the job. Connecting it through internal links is what makes it work for SEO.</p>

        <p>Every page on your site should link to at least 2-3 other relevant pages. Here's how to think about it:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blog posts link to service pages</strong> — "Learn more about our <a href="/services.html">local SEO services</a>"</li>
            <li><strong>Service pages link to blog posts</strong> — "Read our guide on [related topic]"</li>
            <li><strong>Location pages link to service pages and blog posts</strong> — connect the local context to your offerings</li>
            <li><strong>Blog posts link to other blog posts</strong> — create topic clusters around your core services</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This creates a web of connected content that tells Google "this site is an authority on [topic] in [location]." It's the same strategy we use on this site — notice how every article links to 10+ other pages? That's intentional.</p>

        <h2>Content Quality: What Google Actually Wants</h2>

        <p>Google has made it clear with their Helpful Content Update: content needs to be written for humans first, search engines second. What this means practically:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Write from experience</strong> — share real examples from your work, real numbers, real stories from NH customers</li>
            <li><strong>Be specific</strong> — "Our drain cleaning service in <a href="/seo-dover-nh.html">Dover</a> typically takes 1-2 hours and costs $150-300" beats "Contact us for pricing!"</li>
            <li><strong>Don't stuff keywords</strong> — if you're mentioning "plumber Manchester NH" 15 times on a page, that's too many. Write naturally and the keywords will appear naturally. See our guide on <a href="/blog/diy-seo-mistakes.html">common DIY SEO mistakes</a></li>
            <li><strong>Answer the question completely</strong> — if someone searches "how much does HVAC replacement cost in NH," give them the actual range with factors that affect price. Don't hide the answer behind a contact form</li>
            <li><strong>Update content regularly</strong> — a pricing guide from 2023 is outdated. Update it annually at minimum</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Measuring What Works</h2>

        <p>You don't need expensive analytics tools. Google Search Console (free) tells you:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Which pages get the most search impressions and clicks</li>
            <li>What keywords you're ranking for (and your position)</li>
            <li>Which pages are improving or declining</li>
            <li>Mobile usability issues (see our <a href="/blog/mobile-friendly-website-nh.html">mobile-friendly guide</a>)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Check monthly. If a blog post isn't getting any impressions after 3 months, it's targeting a keyword nobody searches. Update it or redirect it to a page that does perform.</p>

        <h2>Real Example: NH Home Services Company</h2>

        <p>A home services company in southern NH came to us with a 5-page website: Home, About, Services, Gallery, Contact. They were invisible on Google for everything except their business name.</p>

        <p>Here's what we built:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>6 individual service pages (one per service they offer)</li>
            <li>4 location pages (Manchester, Nashua, Concord, Merrimack)</li>
            <li>8 blog posts targeting customer questions</li>
            <li>Every page internally linked to 3-5 related pages</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Within 4 months, they were ranking on page 1 for 12 different service+city combinations. Their organic traffic went from ~50 visits/month to ~400. Phone calls from the website tripled.</p>

        <p>That's 18 pages of focused, locally-targeted content doing the work that one generic "Services" page couldn't.</p>
