            <p class="lead">Google changes its search algorithm hundreds of times each year. Most are tiny tweaks nobody notices. But every few months, Google releases major updates that can drastically shift rankings. If your local business traffic suddenly dropped, a Google algorithm update is probably why. Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know&mdash;explained in plain English.</p>

            <h2>What Are Google Algorithm Updates? (Simple Explanation)</h2>

            <p>Google&rsquo;s search engine ranks websites using <strong>hundreds of factors.</strong> An algorithm is the set of rules Google uses to decide which websites should rank highest for each search.</p>

            <p>When Google makes an algorithm <strong>update,</strong> they change those rules. Sometimes they add new ranking factors. Sometimes they weight existing factors differently. Sometimes they penalize websites that break guidelines.</p>

            <p><strong>Why does Google update?</strong> To improve search quality. Google&rsquo;s job is to show users the most relevant, helpful, trustworthy results. As the internet changes and people search differently, Google needs to update its rules to stay accurate.</p>

            <p><strong>Who gets hurt by updates?</strong> Websites that don&rsquo;t follow Google&rsquo;s guidelines. Websites that use outdated SEO tactics. Websites with low-quality content. Websites that rely on link schemes or fake reviews. Legitimate businesses with solid <a href="/blog/local-seo-guide-nh.html">local SEO practices</a> usually aren&rsquo;t affected&mdash;or they benefit.</p>

            <h2>Major Updates That Affect Local Businesses</h2>

            <p>Google releases both <strong>core updates</strong> and <strong>targeted updates.</strong> Core updates reshape the entire ranking landscape. Targeted updates go after specific abuse patterns.</p>

            <h3>Google Core Updates</h3>

            <p>Google releases core updates roughly every 1-3 months. These are the most impactful. Core updates change how Google evaluates content quality, expertise, and authority.</p>

            <p><strong>Recent core updates:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>March 2024 Core Update</strong> &mdash; Major devaluation of AI-generated content and thin content. Helped high-quality, original local guides.</li>
                <li><strong>September 2024 Core Update</strong> &mdash; Further targeting low-quality content. Boosted sites with genuine expertise.</li>
                <li><strong>November 2024 Core Update</strong> &mdash; Focused on reducing spam and AI-generated garbage from search results.</li>
                <li><strong>January 2025 Core Update</strong> &mdash; Refined ranking for E-E-A-T signals. See more below.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Impact on local businesses:</strong> If your local business website has original, helpful content written by experts (you), core updates usually help you. If you have thin pages, AI-generated pages, or copied content, you likely saw rankings drop.</p>

            <h3>Helpful Content System (HCS)</h3>

            <p>Launched in March 2024, Google&rsquo;s Helpful Content System continuously evaluates whether your content is actually helpful to readers or just noise.</p>

            <p>The system checks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is your content original to your site?</li>
                <li>Is it written for actual humans or just search engines?</li>
                <li>Would people bookmark this or share this?</li>
                <li>Does it demonstrate real knowledge and experience?</li>
                <li>Is there thin content that doesn&rsquo;t provide value?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Content that fails these checks gets demoted. Content that passes them can rank higher.</p>

            <p><strong>Local business impact:</strong> Local service pages (plumbers, dentists, restaurants) were hit hard if they had template-based, low-effort content. Pages with genuine service descriptions, real photos, and <a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">authentic business information</a> benefited.</p>

            <h3>Google Spam Update</h3>

            <p>Google released major spam updates in October and December 2024. These targeted:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expired domain abuse</strong> &mdash; Buying old domains that previously ranked and redirecting them</li>
                <li><strong>Link spam</strong> &mdash; Coordinated link schemes and unnatural backlink patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Fake reviews</strong> &mdash; Faked Google reviews, fake testimonials, review manipulation</li>
                <li><strong>Doorway pages</strong> &mdash; Pages created only to rank for keywords, then redirect users</li>
                <li><strong>User-generated spam</strong> &mdash; Forums and platforms flooded with AI spam</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Local business impact:</strong> If your business bought backlinks or fake reviews, you got hit. If you&rsquo;ve been playing by the rules, you likely benefited as spammers got filtered out.</p>

            <h3>Local/Vicinity Update</h3>

            <p>In 2024, Google made updates specifically to local search and the map pack. These changes improved how Google ranks businesses based on distance, relevance, and prominence.</p>

            <p><strong>What changed:</strong> Google now weighs your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a> data more heavily relative to your website content. A business with a complete, optimized GBP profile ranks better than a business with a great website but empty GBP.</p>

            <p><strong>Local business impact:</strong> Businesses that <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-tips.html">optimized their GBP listings</a> saw rankings improve. Businesses that ignored GBP saw their visibility decrease.</p>

            <h2>The November 2024 Core Update &mdash; What Happened</h2>

            <p>The November 2024 Core Update was particularly impactful for local businesses. Here&rsquo;s what shifted:</p>

            <h3>Content Quality Became Even More Important</h3>

            <p>Google further reduced the ranking power of bulk-generated, template-based content. If your service pages say the same thing as your competitors&rsquo; pages, you lost ground. Original content with your unique perspective won.</p>

            <h3>Expertise Signals Got Scrutinized</h3>

            <p>Google looked more closely at whether you actually know what you&rsquo;re writing about. A dentist writing about dental procedures beats a generic content writer. See the <a href="#eeat">E-E-A-T section below</a> for details.</p>

            <h3>Business Signals Mattered More</h3>

            <p>Google cross-referenced your website data with your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile,</a> <a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">NAP consistency</a>, and review signals. Inconsistencies hurt. Consistency helped.</p>

            <h3>Local Reviews Became a Larger Ranking Factor</h3>

            <p>Review quantity, freshness, and sentiment got more weight. A business with 50+ recent reviews in good standing outranked businesses with older or fewer reviews, even if the other factors were equal.</p>

            <h2 id="eeat">The Helpful Content System and E-E-A-T: What It Means for Your Business</h2>

            <p>E-E-A-T is Google&rsquo;s framework for evaluating content quality. You&rsquo;ll see this acronym everywhere in SEO discussions. Let&rsquo;s decode it for <a href="/blog/local-seo-for-small-business.html">small business owners.</a></p>

            <p><strong>E-E-A-T stands for:</strong></p>

            <h3>Experience</h3>

            <p>Do you have firsthand experience with what you&rsquo;re writing about? A plumber writing about unclogging drains beats a marketer writing the same article. For local businesses, showing that you&rsquo;ve been in business for years and have thousands of customer interactions is a massive experience signal.</p>

            <p><strong>How to demonstrate:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Write about your services from your actual perspective</li>
                <li>Share real case studies and before/after photos</li>
                <li>Include your founding year on your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">GBP profile</a></li>
                <li>Accumulate <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">Google reviews</a> from real customers</li>
                <li>Show how long you&rsquo;ve served your local area</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Expertise</h3>

            <p>Are you qualified to write about this topic? Licensing, credentials, professional memberships, and years of practice all signal expertise.</p>

            <p><strong>How to demonstrate:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Display your licenses and certifications on your website</li>
                <li>List professional memberships (electricians guild, bar association, etc.)</li>
                <li>Share your professional bio and credentials</li>
                <li>Show training and continuing education</li>
                <li>Include speaker engagements or media mentions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Authoritativeness</h3>

            <p>Are you recognized as an authority in your field? This comes from external recognition&mdash;reviews, mentions, <a href="/blog/backlinks-local-seo-nh.html">backlinks,</a> press coverage, social proof.</p>

            <p><strong>How to demonstrate:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Build a strong <a href="/blog/backlinks-local-seo-nh.html">local backlink profile</a> from local directories and media</li>
                <li>Get mentioned in local news, trade publications, and industry blogs</li>
                <li>Accumulate high ratings and reviews</li>
                <li>Participate in local business organizations</li>
                <li>Create content that other sites link to and cite</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Trustworthiness</h3>

            <p>Can users and search engines trust you? Transparency, clear business information, honest reviews (including honest responses to negative reviews), and legitimate business signals all build trust.</p>

            <p><strong>How to demonstrate:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make your business information easily findable (address, phone, hours)</li>
                <li>Display customer reviews prominently&mdash;including negative ones with your responses</li>
                <li>Have clear privacy and refund policies</li>
                <li>Respond professionally to negative feedback</li>
                <li>Never manipulate reviews or use fake testimonials</li>
                <li>Complete your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a> with real information</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Local business reality:</strong> E-E-A-T heavily favors established local businesses with years of experience, real reviews, and genuine customer relationships. If you&rsquo;ve been running your business for 5+ years and have 100+ Google reviews, you have massive E-E-A-T advantages over new competitors. Leverage this.</p>

            <h2>Google AI Overviews and Local Business Visibility</h2>

            <p>In 2024, Google rolled out AI Overviews (formerly SGE&mdash;Search Generative Experience). This changes how local businesses appear in search results.</p>

            <h3>What Are AI Overviews?</h3>

            <p>When you search for certain queries, Google now displays an AI-generated summary at the top of the results. The AI pulls information from multiple sources to answer your question.</p>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Search &ldquo;best plumber in Manchester&rdquo; on Google. You might see an AI summary with tips on choosing a plumber, then below that, the map pack with actual businesses.</p>

            <h3>Impact on Local Businesses</h3>

            <p><strong>The good:</strong> If your website or <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">GBP profile</a> gets cited in an AI Overview, you get additional visibility.</p>

            <p><strong>The challenge:</strong> AI Overviews take up screen space. On some queries, the overview + map pack now dominate, leaving less room for organic rankings.</p>

            <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Optimize your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a> completely. AI Overviews pull from GBP data.</li>
                <li>Create detailed <a href="/blog/landing-page-optimization.html">location pages</a> for each city you serve. AI pulls from these.</li>
                <li>Answer common questions about your services on your website. AI looks for Q&A format.</li>
                <li>Use <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">schema markup</a> to mark up your business information. AI systems read this.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Google Spam Update Targets: What Gets Penalized</h2>

            <p>Google&rsquo;s December 2024 spam update and ongoing spam detection systems target these specific tactics:</p>

            <h3>Link Schemes</h3>

            <p>Buying backlinks, participating in link exchanges, using private blog networks (PBNs), or any unnatural linking pattern that&rsquo;s clearly designed to manipulate rankings.</p>

            <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Thousands of websites got penalized. Some lost 80%+ of traffic.</p>

            <p><strong>Local business lesson:</strong> Don&rsquo;t buy local directory listings promising backlinks. Don&rsquo;t use link-building services. Build <a href="/blog/backlinks-local-seo-nh.html">legitimate backlinks</a> from real local sources (chambers of commerce, local news, industry listings).</p>

            <h3>Fake Reviews</h3>

            <p>Posting fake Google reviews, Yelp reviews, or Amazon reviews. Faking testimonials on your website. Using review services to artificially inflate ratings.</p>

            <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Google now has automated systems detecting fake review patterns. Fake reviews get filtered. Businesses doing this get manual penalties.</p>

            <p><strong>Local business lesson:</strong> Ask real customers for reviews. <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">Build a genuine review system.</a> Never pay for reviews or create fake ones.</p>

            <h3>Doorway Pages</h3>

            <p>Creating pages designed only to rank and redirect users elsewhere. Example: landing page for &ldquo;plumber Manchester&rdquo; that immediately redirects to your home page.</p>

            <p><strong>Local business lesson:</strong> Every page on your site should serve actual users. <a href="/blog/landing-page-optimization.html">Location pages</a> should be detailed, useful pages&mdash;not thin redirects.</p>

            <h3>Expired Domain Abuse</h3>

            <p>Buying old domains that previously ranked and filling them with new content to inherit their authority.</p>

            <p><strong>Local business lesson:</strong> Not applicable to most local businesses. But if you&rsquo;re considering this tactic, don&rsquo;t. Google catches it.</p>

            <h2>How to Protect Your Site From Algorithm Penalties</h2>

            <p>The best defense is following white-hat SEO practices. Here&rsquo;s what legitimate local businesses should do:</p>

            <h3>1. Focus on Genuine Expertise and Original Content</h3>

            <p>Write about your services from your perspective. Share real case studies. Show your credentials. Don&rsquo;t copy content from competitors or AI-generate thin pages.</p>

            <h3>2. Build Your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a> Completely</h3>

            <p>This is non-negotiable. A complete, verified, optimized GBP is your best defense against algorithm shifts.</p>

            <h3>3. Get Real Reviews and Respond Professionally</h3>

            <p>Ask customers to leave <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">Google reviews.</a> Respond to every review within 24 hours. This signals freshness and authority.</p>

            <h3>4. Maintain <a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">NAP Consistency</a></h3>

            <p>Your business Name, Address, and Phone must be identical everywhere: website, GBP, local directories, citations. Inconsistencies confuse Google and hurt rankings.</p>

            <h3>5. Build Legitimate Backlinks</h3>

            <p>Don&rsquo;t buy links. Instead:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get listed in local directories and chambers of commerce</li>
                <li>Get mentioned in local news and trade publications</li>
                <li>Create content worth linking to</li>
                <li><a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">Build local citations</a> on relevant industry sites</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Use <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">Schema Markup</a></h3>

            <p>Add structured data to your website so Google can easily read your business information, hours, reviews, and location.</p>

            <h3>7. Keep Your Information Fresh and Accurate</h3>

            <p>Update your hours, services, photos, and content regularly. Stale information signals inactivity.</p>

            <h3>8. Never Use Black-Hat Tactics</h3>

            <p>Avoid: keyword stuffing, cloaking, link buying, fake reviews, doorway pages, hidden text. These aren&rsquo;t just algorithm risks&mdash;they can get you manually penalized or banned entirely.</p>

            <h2>What to Do If Your Rankings Drop After an Update</h2>

            <p>If your traffic dropped after a Google update, follow this diagnostic checklist:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Check What Update Happened</h3>

            <p>Google publishes updates on Twitter/X (@searchliaison) and in industry reports. Was there a core update, spam update, or local update? Knowing which update helps diagnose the problem.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Review Your Content Quality</h3>

            <p>Ask yourself honestly: Is my content original and helpful? Would a real person want to read this? Or is it thin, repetitive, or AI-generated? If it&rsquo;s the latter, rewrite it.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Audit Your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a></h3>

            <p>Is it complete? Verified? Optimized with full business details, photos, and services? Missing GBP optimization is often the culprit in local ranking drops.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Check Your Review Signals</h3>

            <p>How many reviews do you have? When was the last one? How are you responding? If your review count hasn&rsquo;t grown in months, that could be the issue.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Verify <a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">NAP Consistency</a></h3>

            <p>Search for your business name online. Does your address and phone match everywhere? Inconsistencies can trigger ranking drops.</p>

            <h3>Step 6: Analyze Your Backlinks</h3>

            <p>Do you have unnatural links? Did you recently buy backlinks? Use Google Search Console to see your backlink profile. If there are suspicious patterns, disavow them.</p>

            <h3>Step 7: Check Your GBP for Violations</h3>

            <p>Are you following Google&rsquo;s guidelines? No keyword-stuffed business names. No fake address. No policy violations. Any of these can trigger a suspension or demotion.</p>

            <h3>Step 8: Wait and Monitor</h3>

            <p>Algorithm recoveries take time&mdash;usually 2-4 weeks. Fix the issues, then monitor your rankings. If you made legitimate improvements, you should recover.</p>

            <h2>Why "SEO Is Dead" Claims Are Always Wrong</h2>

            <p>Every Google update, someone says &ldquo;SEO is dead.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s always wrong. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>

            <h3>Google Still Needs to Rank Websites</h3>

            <p>Google hasn&rsquo;t changed its fundamental job: rank the most relevant, helpful, trustworthy websites highest. That&rsquo;s SEO. Even with AI Overviews and AI-generated answers, Google still needs to find and rank sources.</p>

            <h3>Algorithm Updates Actually Help Good Businesses</h3>

            <p>When Google penalizes spam and low-quality content, legitimate businesses benefit. Your competition gets filtered out. That&rsquo;s good for you.</p>

            <h3>The Rules Got Stricter, Not Harder</h3>

            <p>SEO isn&rsquo;t dead. Black-hat SEO is dead. The tactics that worked in 2015 (buying links, keyword stuffing, thin content) don&rsquo;t work anymore. But the fundamentals&mdash;authority, relevance, user experience, business signals&mdash;are more important than ever.</p>

            <h3>Local SEO Is Actually Growing</h3>

            <p>Mobile searches include &ldquo;near me&rdquo; queries at record rates. People are more likely than ever to search for local businesses. SEO isn&rsquo;t dead for local businesses&mdash;it&rsquo;s more valuable than ever.</p>

            <h2>Building an Update-Proof SEO Strategy</h2>

            <p>The best protection against algorithm changes is a strategy that doesn&rsquo;t rely on exploits. Here&rsquo;s how to build one:</p>

            <h3>1. Invest in Real Content Quality</h3>

            <p>Write pages that answer the questions your customers actually ask. Share your genuine expertise. Show real examples from your business. This content stays valuable through every algorithm change.</p>

            <h3>2. Prioritize Business Signals</h3>

            <p>Google cares about real business signals more than technical tricks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer reviews and ratings</li>
                <li>How long you&rsquo;ve been in business</li>
                <li>Information consistency across the web</li>
                <li>Local mentions and citations</li>
                <li>Physical business presence and legitimacy</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These signals are stable. They won&rsquo;t change with updates because they measure real business quality.</p>

            <h3>3. Build Your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a> Like Your Primary Asset</h3>

            <p>Your GBP is now more important than ever. Treat it like your most valuable digital property. Keep it complete, accurate, and active.</p>

            <h3>4. Create Location Pages That Actually Help Users</h3>

            <p>Don&rsquo;t create thin city pages. Create detailed, unique pages for each location you serve. Include real information about that area, local reviews, local examples. Make them useful. See our <a href="/blog/landing-page-optimization.html">landing page guide</a> for details.</p>

            <h3>5. Earn <a href="/blog/backlinks-local-seo-nh.html">Legitimate Backlinks</a></h3>

            <p>Stop buying links. Start creating content worth linking to. Build relationships with local media, chambers of commerce, and industry partners. <a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">Build citations</a> on reputable local directories.</p>

            <h3>6. Use <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">Schema Markup</a> Properly</h3>

            <p>Structured data helps Google understand your content. It&rsquo;s becoming more important. Use it correctly: LocalBusiness schema on your home page, separate schema for each location page, review schema for testimonials.</p>

            <h3>7. Monitor and Respond to Reviews</h3>

            <p><a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">Reviews are a ranking factor.</a> Build a system to ask customers for reviews and respond professionally. This ongoing signal is algorithm-proof.</p>

            <h3>8. Stay Informed (But Don&rsquo;t Panic)</h3>

            <p>Follow Google Search Central on Twitter/X and read industry updates. But don&rsquo;t panic every time there&rsquo;s an update. If you&rsquo;re following white-hat practices, you&rsquo;ll be fine. If you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;ll deserve the penalty.</p>

            <h2>The Takeaway</h2>

            <p>Google algorithm updates are a fact of life in SEO. But they&rsquo;re not your enemy if you&rsquo;re running your business legitimately. Algorithm updates punish cheaters and reward real quality. That&rsquo;s good news for you.</p>

            <p>The most update-proof strategy is simple: Be the best version of your business. Share your genuine expertise. Collect real customer feedback. Keep your information consistent and fresh. Build authority through legitimate means. Do these things, and you&rsquo;ll survive every algorithm change Google throws at you.</p>
