            <p class="lead">Self-storage operators understand occupancy pressure. Every empty unit is lost revenue. Every reservation lost to a competitor&rsquo;s website is a direct revenue hit. Google Business Profile optimization and local SEO aren&rsquo;t nice-to-haves&mdash;they&rsquo;re the fastest, cheapest way to fill units and compete with Public Storage, CubeSmart, and other regional operators.</p>

            <p>When someone searches &ldquo;storage units near me&rdquo; or &ldquo;climate controlled storage [city],&rdquo; Google shows 3-5 facility listings. The top spots capture 60-80% of clicks. This guide shows you exactly how to own those top positions.</p>

            <h2>Why Storage Operators Need SEO (Right Now)</h2>

            <p>The self-storage market is consolidating. National chains spend aggressively on Google Ads and local SEO. But they can&rsquo;t compete with genuine, hyperlocal optimization. Here&rsquo;s the reality:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Seasonal demand spikes are predictable.</strong> Summer moving season, college move-ins (August), and holiday relocations. You need to rank during these windows. Ads alone aren&rsquo;t sustainable year-round.</li>
                <li><strong>&ldquo;Storage near me&rdquo; searches convert fast.</strong> Someone searching this is actively looking to rent. They&rsquo;re not browsing—they&rsquo;re ready to drive to your facility.</li>
                <li><strong>Google favors local businesses on Google Maps.</strong> If you optimize correctly, you&rsquo;ll show up above chains that only use corporate profiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Unit-specific pages rank for long-tail keywords.</strong> Create pages for climate-controlled, vehicle storage, or business storage, and you rank for multiple intent variations.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Compare this to Google Ads, which cost $2-5+ per click for storage keywords. At a 5% conversion rate, that&rsquo;s $40-100 per reservation. Organic search? After setup, it&rsquo;s nearly free.</p>

            <p><strong>The math:</strong> One extra reservation per week = $1,500-2,500/month in new revenue (depending on unit mix and average lease). RankRise&rsquo;s <a href="/free-audit.html">free audit</a> will show exactly which SEO opportunities you&rsquo;re leaving on the table.</p>

            <h2>Why Google Business Profile Is Your Foundation</h2>

            <p>Your <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-optimization-guide.html">Google Business Profile (GBP)</a> is where customers find your facility, see your amenities, check hours, and—critically—see your occupancy status and unit availability. Neglecting it means losing 60%+ of potential online rentals.</p>

            <h3>Complete Your GBP With These Storage-Specific Elements</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Claim and verify your profile immediately.</strong> Go to <a href="https://business.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business.google.com</a> and claim your facility now. Competitors may already be listed under your business name.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary category:</strong> &ldquo;Self-Storage Facility&rdquo; or &ldquo;Storage Unit.&rdquo; This must match your industry exactly.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary categories:</strong> Add &ldquo;Moving and Storage,&rdquo; &ldquo;Warehouse Facility,&rdquo; and if applicable: &ldquo;Climate Control Storage,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vehicle Storage,&rdquo; &ldquo;Boat Storage,&rdquo; &ldquo;Business Storage.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Business name:</strong> Use your legal name. No keyword stuffing (e.g., don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;Climate Controlled Storage Units Near Downtown&rdquo; if that&rsquo;s not your registered name).</li>
                <li><strong>Address and phone:</strong> Must be exact and consistent with your website and all directories. <a href="/blog/local-citations-nap-consistency.html">NAP consistency (Name, Address, Phone) is crucial for rankings</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Hours:</strong> List exact hours. If you have gate codes for 24/7 access but staffed office hours, list both.</li>
                <li><strong>Business description (750 characters):</strong> Write for renters, not robots. Example: &ldquo;Climate-controlled storage units in [City] since 2015. 24/7 access, ground-floor units, climate control, business storage, RV/boat parking. 10x10, 10x20, 5x5 units available. Secure, affordable, customer-focused.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Amenities attributes:</strong> This is critical for storage. Check every applicable attribute: 24/7 access, climate control, security cameras, gated facility, ground floor units, handicap accessible, loading dock, fenced outdoor storage, vehicle storage, business storage. See our <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-categories-guide.html">complete GBP categories guide</a> for all options.</li>
                <li><strong>Unit types attribute:</strong> List each unit size you offer. Google will show renters your unit inventory directly in search results. Example: 5x5, 5x10, 10x10, 10x15, 10x20, 10x30.</li>
                <li><strong>Pricing information:</strong> Optional but powerful. If you list &ldquo;10x10 from $99/month,&rdquo; renters see price before clicking. This filters low-intent visitors.</li>
                <li><strong>30+ photos and video tours:</strong> Show unit interiors, climate control systems, security gates, office, parking areas, testimonials. Video tours dramatically increase conversion rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Posts weekly:</strong> Publish seasonal content: &ldquo;Summer Moving Season: Reserve Your Unit Now,&rdquo; &ldquo;New Climate-Controlled Units Available,&rdquo; &ldquo;Student Move-In Special August 1-15.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Q&A section:</strong> Answer the questions you get constantly: &ldquo;What size unit do I need?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you have climate control?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is there 24/7 access?&rdquo; &ldquo;How much does storage cost?&rdquo;</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Unit Type Pages: Rank for Every Search Variation</h2>

            <p>Don&rsquo;t just list &ldquo;we have storage.&rdquo; Create dedicated landing pages for each unit type and use case. This captures every variation of intent renters search for.</p>

            <h3>Core Unit Type Pages for Storage Facilities</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate-Controlled Storage:</strong> Target keywords: &ldquo;climate controlled storage [city],&rdquo; &ldquo;temperature-controlled units,&rdquo; &ldquo;climate storage cost,&rdquo; &ldquo;best storage for electronics.&rdquo; Explain benefits: protects against mold, humidity damage, temperature swings.</li>
                <li><strong>Vehicle Storage (RV, Boat, Car):</strong> Target: &ldquo;RV storage [city],&rdquo; &ldquo;boat storage near me,&rdquo; &ldquo;vehicle storage,&rdquo; &ldquo;outdoor covered parking.&rdquo; Emphasize security and weatherproofing.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Storage:</strong> Target: &ldquo;business storage [city],&rdquo; &ldquo;commercial storage,&rdquo; &ldquo;inventory storage,&rdquo; &ldquo;office overflow storage.&rdquo; Address business-specific concerns: access during business hours, insurance, reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Ground Floor Units:</strong> Target: &ldquo;ground floor storage units,&rdquo; &ldquo;no-stairs storage,&rdquo; &ldquo;accessible storage.&rdquo; Key for elderly, disabled, or busy renters.</li>
                <li><strong>Small/Large Unit Specific Pages:</strong> Create pages for popular sizes: &ldquo;5x5 storage units,&rdquo; &ldquo;10x10 storage,&rdquo; &ldquo;10x20 storage [city].&rdquo; Help renters choose the right size. Include packing lists (e.g., &ldquo;What fits in a 10x10: 1-2 bedroom furniture, boxes, etc.&rdquo;).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>On each unit type page:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Lead with a clear benefit: &ldquo;Climate-controlled storage protects your belongings from temperature swings, mold, and humidity damage. Ideal for furniture, electronics, and documents.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>Answer customer questions: &ldquo;How much does climate control cost?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it worth it?&rdquo; &ldquo;What should I store in climate control?&rdquo;</li>
                <li>Include photos of the unit type in action.</li>
                <li>Show pricing (or pricing ranges).</li>
                <li>Include customer reviews/testimonials specific to that unit type.</li>
                <li>Strong CTA: &ldquo;Reserve Your [Unit Type] Today—$0 Move-In Special.&rdquo;</li>
                <li>Link to related pages: <a href="/blog/on-page-seo-local-business.html">follow on-page SEO best practices</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>&ldquo;Storage Near Me&rdquo; Optimization: Capturing High-Intent Searchers</h2>

            <p>&ldquo;Storage near me&rdquo; and &ldquo;storage units near me&rdquo; are your goldmines. These are ultra-high-intent searches from people actively looking to rent right now.</p>

            <p><strong>High-intent storage keywords:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>&ldquo;Storage units near me&rdquo;</li>
                <li>&ldquo;Self-storage [city]&rdquo;</li>
                <li>&ldquo;Climate controlled storage near me&rdquo;</li>
                <li>&ldquo;Storage facility [neighborhood]&rdquo;</li>
                <li>&ldquo;Affordable storage units&rdquo;</li>
                <li>&ldquo;Move-in specials [city]&rdquo;</li>
                <li>&ldquo;24/7 storage access&rdquo;</li>
                <li>&ldquo;Vehicle storage [city]&rdquo;</li>
                <li>&ldquo;Storage units available now&rdquo;</li>
                <li>&ldquo;Cheapest storage [city]&rdquo;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To rank for these:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Ensure your GBP is 100% optimized with amenities, unit sizes, and photos. <a href="/blog/local-seo-checklist-2026.html">Use our 2026 local SEO checklist</a> to verify.</li>
                <li>Make sure your facility address is exact and consistent everywhere (website, Google, Yelp, directories).</li>
                <li>Get reviews. Lots of them. See &ldquo;Review Strategy After Move-In&rdquo; section below.</li>
                <li>Create content targeting these exact keywords.</li>
                <li>Track your rankings monthly for the top 10 &ldquo;near me&rdquo; variations.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Seasonal Demand: Optimize for Summer, College Move-Ins, and Holidays</h2>

            <p>Self-storage demand is cyclical. 60% of moves happen May-September. College students move in August. Holiday storage spikes in November-December. Smart operators adjust SEO and content for seasonal demand.</p>

            <h3>May-September: Summer Moving Season</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Content focus:</strong> &ldquo;Summer Moving Checklist,&rdquo; &ldquo;How to Pack a Storage Unit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Beat Summer Moving Season Stress.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Google Posts:</strong> Run weekly promos: &ldquo;Moving This Summer? Reserve Now—First Month $49,&rdquo; &ldquo;Last-Minute Storage Available.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>GBP focus:</strong> Ensure all unit sizes are shown as &ldquo;Available.&rdquo; Post daily availability updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Pricing strategy:</strong> Many facilities run discounts May-July to fill summer vacancy, then raise rates August-September when demand peaks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>August: College Move-In Bonanza</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target keywords:</strong> &ldquo;College storage [city],&rdquo; &ldquo;Student move-in storage,&rdquo; &ldquo;storage for college break,&rdquo; &ldquo;summer storage students.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Landing page:</strong> Create a dedicated &ldquo;Student Storage&rdquo; page. Explain why students need storage (living off-campus, home breaks, furniture, study overflow).</li>
                <li><strong>Google Posts:</strong> &ldquo;College Students: Reserve Your Summer Storage by July 15 for Best Selection.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>GBP updates:</strong> Post daily through August: &ldquo;College Move-In Help Available. Reserve Your Unit.&rdquo;</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>November-December: Holiday and Year-End Storage</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target keywords:</strong> &ldquo;Holiday decoration storage,&rdquo; &ldquo;seasonal storage,&rdquo; &ldquo;temporary storage [city],&rdquo; &ldquo;storage for holiday items.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Content:</strong> &ldquo;Where to Store Your Holiday Decorations,&rdquo; &ldquo;Spring Cleaning Storage Tips,&rdquo; &ldquo;Downsizing for the New Year.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>GBP Posts:</strong> &ldquo;Holiday Storage Solutions. Climate Control Protects Your Decorations.&rdquo;</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pricing Page Optimization: Show Confidence in Your Rates</h2>

            <p>Transparent pricing builds trust. Hidden fees kill conversion and reviews. Create a dedicated pricing page that shows unit sizes, amenities, and exact costs.</p>

            <h3>Pricing Page Essentials</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pricing table:</strong> Show unit size (5x5, 10x10, etc.), base price, climate-controlled price, and availability status.</li>
                <li><strong>Address hidden fees:</strong> &ldquo;No administrative fees. No lock-up charges. No surprise fees.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Move-in specials:</strong> Be transparent: &ldquo;First Month $49 when you sign a 6-month lease. Expires March 31.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Discounts:</strong> List military, senior, first-responder, or loyalty discounts explicitly.</li>
                <li><strong>FAQ:</strong> &ldquo;Can I negotiate price?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you raise rates?&rdquo; &ldquo;What if I pay yearly?&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>CTA:</strong> &ldquo;Reserve Your Unit at These Rates Today. Prices May Increase.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Keyword targeting:</strong> This page should rank for &ldquo;storage cost,&rdquo; &ldquo;storage prices [city],&rdquo; &ldquo;affordable storage.&rdquo;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Pro tip: Update pricing page monthly or quarterly to reflect market rates. Fresh content sends a &ldquo;active business&rdquo; signal to Google.</p>

            <h2>Review Strategy: The Post-Move-In Campaign</h2>

            <p><a href="/blog/google-reviews-ranking-factor.html">Reviews directly impact rankings and conversion rates</a>. Renters making storage decisions rely heavily on reviews. And Google's algorithm loves fresh reviews.</p>

            <h3>Systematic Review Campaign After Move-In</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Within 24 hours of move-in:</strong> Send a text or email: &ldquo;Move-in complete? We'd love your feedback. [Google Review Link]&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Month 1:</strong> Follow-up email: &ldquo;How's your storage experience? Leave a review and help other renters find us.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Month 6 and 12:</strong> Loyalty nudges: &ldquo;We've been protecting your belongings for 6 months. Share your experience on Google.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Target: 50-100+ reviews.</strong> At this volume, new reviews have less noise impact but show consistent quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Star target: 4.5+ stars.</strong> A few 4-star reviews build credibility (all 5-star looks fake). Mix of detailed reviews is better than volume alone.</li>
                <li><strong>Respond to all reviews.</strong> Thank positive reviews. Professionally address negatives: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry we missed the mark. Contact us directly to make this right.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Showcase social proof:</strong> Pull 3-5 top review snippets and display them on your homepage and pricing page.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Multi-platform review strategy:</strong> Encourage reviews on Google (most important), Yelp, Facebook, StorageCafe, SpareFoot, and BBB. Each platform adds authority.</p>

            <h2>Local Citations: Where Google Verifies You</h2>

            <p><a href="/blog/local-citations-nap-consistency.html">Local citations are directory listings that tell Google your business is real and trustworthy</a>. For storage facilities, certain directories carry massive weight.</p>

            <h3>Tier 1 Storage Citations (Most Critical)</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Business Profile</strong> (already claimed, yes?)</li>
                <li><strong>StorageCafe</strong> — The largest storage directory. Gets 5M+ visits/month. Must-have.</li>
                <li><strong>SpareFoot</strong> — High-traffic storage comparison site. Massive authority.</li>
                <li><strong>Yelp</strong> — Still drives traffic and reviews for storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Apple Maps</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Bing Places</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Facebook Business Page</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tier 2 Citations (Storage-Specific Directories)</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Move.com</strong> — Storage + moving combo search.</li>

                <li><strong>BBB (Better Business Bureau)</strong> — Trust signal for high-value decisions.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Citation Optimization Checklist</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Standardize NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across all directories. Example: Use &ldquo;Main Street Storage&rdquo; everywhere, not &ldquo;Main Street Storage LLC&rdquo; one place and &ldquo;Mainstreet Storage&rdquo; another.</li>
                <li>Ensure website URL is consistent (www.example.com vs. example.com).</li>
                <li>Claim and verify StorageCafe and SpareFoot immediately.</li>
                <li>Create listings on all Tier 1 and Tier 2 directories above.</li>
                <li>Monitor quarterly for duplicate or outdated listings.</li>
                <li>Ensure business hours are accurate everywhere.</li>
                <li>Update amenities/unit types on all directories when you add new units or services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Competing With Public Storage, CubeSmart, and Regional Chains</h2>

            <p>National chains have budget. They don&rsquo;t have hyperlocal focus. Here&rsquo;s how independent and regional operators win against them:</p>

            <h3>Your Competitive Advantages</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal touch:</strong> You know your renters. Feature customer stories on your website and GBP. Create a &ldquo;Meet the Team&rdquo; page. This humanizes you.</li>
                <li><strong>Local partnerships:</strong> Partner with local moving companies, real estate agents, and downsizing consultants. Cross-promote and get referrals.</li>
                <li><strong>Community involvement:</strong> Sponsor local events, sports teams, or charities. Mention this on your website and in content. It builds local authority.</li>
                <li><strong>Unique amenities:</strong> If you offer something chains don&rsquo;t (ground-floor units, small/large variety, 24/7 staffing, free moving boxes), make this the centerpiece of your SEO messaging.</li>
                <li><strong>Neighborhood expertise:</strong> Create content about your specific neighborhood: &ldquo;Storage Guide for [Neighborhood]: Why [Neighborhood] Residents Choose Us.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Pricing transparency:</strong> Chains hide pricing. You show it. &ldquo;No Surprises, No Hidden Fees.&rdquo;</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Direct Competitor Research</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Search &ldquo;storage units [your city]&rdquo; and document the top 5 results. Check their GBP photos, reviews, and amenities. Where are they strong? Where are they weak?</li>
                <li>Check their websites: Do they have pricing pages? Blog content? Service pages?</li>
                <li>Look at their reviews on Google, Yelp, StorageCafe. What complaints are common? (Slow office, unclear pricing, damaged units, etc.) Position yourself as the solution.</li>
                <li>Monitor their Google Posts and GBP updates. If they post weekly specials, match or beat them.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Content Marketing: Rank for Informational Intent</h2>

            <p>Not all search intent is transactional (rent now). Some renters are researching: How much does storage cost? How do I pack? Should I get climate control? Content targeting these informational queries builds traffic and authority.</p>

            <h3>Content Ideas for Storage Operators</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Storage tips:</strong> &ldquo;How to Pack a Storage Unit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Climate Control: Do You Need It?,&rdquo; &ldquo;Organizing a 10x10 Unit,&rdquo; &ldquo;How to Protect Furniture in Storage.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Moving guides:</strong> &ldquo;Moving Checklist for [City],&rdquo; &ldquo;DIY vs. Professional Moving,&rdquo; &ldquo;Storage Solutions During a Move.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Downsizing guides:</strong> &ldquo;How to Downsize Your Home,&rdquo; &ldquo;Storage Solutions for Empty Nesters,&rdquo; &ldquo;Minimalist Living: When Storage Helps.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Cost guides:</strong> &ldquo;Average Storage Cost [City],&rdquo; &ldquo;Storage vs. Keeping Belongings at Home: Cost Breakdown,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ways to Save on Storage.&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Local lifestyle content:</strong> &ldquo;New to [City]? Storage Solutions for Relocating Families,&rdquo; &ldquo;[City] College Student Guide: Summer Storage.&rdquo;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each piece should link back to relevant service pages: &ldquo;Climate Control: Do You Need It?&rdquo; links to your climate-controlled storage page. This builds internal link equity and guides prospects to conversion.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Unit Reservations From Organic Search</h2>

            <p>You need to measure if SEO actually fills units. Track these metrics religiously:</p>

            <h3>Key Metrics for Storage SEO</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic traffic to website:</strong> Use Google Analytics 4. Track monthly sessions, especially to pricing and unit pages.</li>
                <li><strong>GBP insights:</strong> Monitor monthly: actions (call, direction requests, website clicks), calls from GBP, and inquiries submitted through GBP.</li>
                <li><strong>Conversion rate:</strong> Divide monthly reservations from organic by monthly organic sessions. Track this monthly.</li>
                <li><strong>Keyword rankings:</strong> Track your top 10-15 target keywords monthly (use SE Ranking, Ahrefs, or manual tracking). Focus on &ldquo;near me&rdquo; and unit-type keywords.</li>
                <li><strong>Phone tracking:</strong> Use call tracking numbers on your website to measure calls from organic search. Or simply ask every lead: &ldquo;Where did you hear about us?&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Form submissions:</strong> If you have a contact form on your website, track completions and attribute them to organic traffic.</li>
                <li><strong>Average move-in value:</strong> Calculate the average monthly rent per new unit. Multiply by expected lease length (typically 6-12 months) to get customer lifetime value.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Comparing SEO to Google Ads for Storage</h3>

                </tr>
            </table>

            <p><strong>Hybrid approach:</strong> Smart operators run Google Ads during peak seasons (May-September, August college season) while building organic SEO year-round. This gives immediate traffic during high-demand periods and sustainable free traffic during slower months.</p>

            <h2>When to Hire Professional SEO Help</h2>

            <p>You can do storage SEO yourself. But consider professional help if:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You don&rsquo;t have 3-5 hours/month to invest in SEO.</li>
                <li>You&rsquo;ve optimized GBP and created unit pages but still aren&rsquo;t ranking after 3 months.</li>
                <li>You operate multiple storage facilities and need coordinated multi-location strategy.</li>
                <li>Competitors are outranking you and you need to catch up fast.</li>
                <li>You want to focus on facility operations, not digital marketing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you hire an agency, ensure they:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Have specific experience with storage facilities (not just generic local SEO)</li>
                <li>Can show case studies or references from other storage operators</li>
                <li>Focus on measurable results: reservations from organic, not just rankings</li>
                <li>Provide monthly reporting on leads and occupancy impact</li>
                <li>Don&rsquo;t make unrealistic promises (&ldquo;#1 guaranteed&rdquo;)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>One Final Thought</h2>

            <p>Self-storage is about trust. Renters are trusting you with their belongings—memories, business inventory, seasonal items. That relationship starts online. When they search &ldquo;storage near me,&rdquo; you need to be there, easy to find, and easy to trust.</p>

            <p>Proper SEO and a well-optimized Google Business Profile communicate that you&rsquo;re professional, established, and customer-focused. You're not a fly-by-night operator. You're the local storage facility that takes their belongings as seriously as they do.</p>

            <p>The operators who invest in local SEO now will own their markets in 12-24 months. The ones who wait will be competing on price with everyone else, including the national chains that can afford discounts.</p>

            <p>Start this week. Optimize your GBP. Collect reviews. Monitor your rankings. Then watch your occupancy climb.</p>
