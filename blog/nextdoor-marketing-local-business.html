            <p class="intro-text">Every local business knows about Google, Facebook, and Yelp. But there is one platform that most businesses completely overlook — and it might be the most targeted local marketing channel available: Nextdoor. With over 90 million verified users across 340,000+ neighborhoods, Nextdoor is where your neighbors go to ask "who is a good plumber?" and "any recommendations for a dentist nearby?"</p>

            <p>Unlike Facebook or Instagram where you are competing with cat videos and vacation photos, Nextdoor is purpose-built for local conversations. When someone asks for a recommendation on Nextdoor, they are ready to hire. This guide shows you how to take full advantage of it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>What Makes Nextdoor Different</h2>

            <p>Nextdoor is fundamentally different from other social platforms, and that matters for your marketing strategy:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verified users</strong> — Every member must verify their home address. No bots, no fake accounts. These are real people who live in your service area.</li>
                <li><strong>Hyper-local</strong> — Content is organized by neighborhood. You reach people within miles of your business, not random followers across the country.</li>
                <li><strong>High trust</strong> — Recommendations from verified neighbors carry significantly more weight than anonymous online reviews.</li>
                <li><strong>Intent-driven</strong> — Most business-related posts on Nextdoor are people actively looking for services ("Can anyone recommend an electrician?").</li>
                <li><strong>Low competition</strong> — Most businesses have not set up a Nextdoor Business Page. You face far less competition than on Google or Facebook.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendation engine</strong> — When neighbors recommend your business, those recommendations show up permanently on your Business Page.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Setting Up Your Nextdoor Business Page</h2>

            <p>Nextdoor Business Pages are free to create and manage. Here is how to set one up:</p>

            <h3>Step-by-Step Setup</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to <a href="https://business.nextdoor.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business.nextdoor.com</a></li>
                <li>Click "Claim your free Business Page"</li>
                <li>Search for your business (Nextdoor may already have a listing from user recommendations)</li>
                <li>If found, claim it. If not, create a new one.</li>
                <li>Verify your business through the options provided (phone, email, or postcard)</li>
                <li>Complete your profile — every field matters</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Optimizing Your Business Page</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Business name</strong> — Use your real business name (same as on Google and your website)</li>
                <li><strong>Category</strong> — Choose the most relevant category. This determines which recommendation prompts your business appears in.</li>
                <li><strong>Address</strong> — Your real business address, matching all other platforms</li>
                <li><strong>Phone number</strong> — Consistent with your GBP and website (<a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">NAP consistency</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Website URL</strong> — Link to your homepage or a dedicated landing page</li>
                <li><strong>Business story</strong> — Write a compelling description. Mention your neighborhood, years in business, and what makes you different.</li>
                <li><strong>Photos</strong> — Upload your logo, team photos, and photos of your work. Businesses with photos get significantly more engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Hours</strong> — Keep them current</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>The Power of Nextdoor Recommendations</h2>

            <p>Nextdoor recommendations are the platform's equivalent of Google reviews — but arguably more powerful for local businesses.</p>

            <h3>How Recommendations Work</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Any Nextdoor member can recommend a business they have used</li>
                <li>Recommendations appear on your Business Page permanently</li>
                <li>When someone in the neighborhood searches for your service category, businesses with the most recommendations rank higher</li>
                <li>Recommendations also appear in the news feed when neighbors ask for suggestions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Get More Recommendations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ask your customers</strong> — After completing a job, ask if they are on Nextdoor and would recommend your business</li>
                <li><strong>Add it to your follow-up</strong> — Include Nextdoor alongside Google when requesting reviews: "If you are happy with our work, we would love a recommendation on Google or Nextdoor"</li>
                <li><strong>Include a link</strong> — Share your Nextdoor Business Page URL in follow-up emails and texts</li>
                <li><strong>Respond to every recommendation</strong> — Thank people publicly. It shows you are engaged and encourages others to recommend you.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recommendations vs Google Reviews</h3>
            <div class="table-wrapper">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Feature</th>
                            <th>Nextdoor Recommendations</th>
                            <th>Google Reviews</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>Reviewer identity</td><td>Verified neighbor with real address</td><td>Google account (can be anonymous)</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Trust level</td><td>Very high (real neighbor)</td><td>High (but some fake reviews exist)</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Visibility</td><td>Neighborhood-level</td><td>Global</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>SEO impact</td><td>Indirect (citation signal)</td><td>Direct ranking factor</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Star ratings</td><td>No stars, text-based</td><td>1-5 star system</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Negative reviews</td><td>Less common (community pressure)</td><td>Common</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Free Marketing: Business Posts</h2>

            <p>Nextdoor allows businesses to publish free posts that appear in the news feeds of nearby neighborhoods. This is one of the most underused free marketing tools available to local businesses.</p>

            <h3>What to Post</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Helpful tips</strong> — "5 signs your furnace needs servicing before winter" or "How to prepare your lawn for spring"</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonal reminders</strong> — "Do not forget to schedule your AC tune-up before summer" or "Ice dam season is here — here is what to watch for"</li>
                <li><strong>Community involvement</strong> — "We donated supplies to [local school]" or "Proud to sponsor [local event]"</li>
                <li><strong>Special offers</strong> — "15% off for neighbors this month" (Nextdoor users respond well to neighbor-exclusive deals)</li>
                <li><strong>Behind the scenes</strong> — Team photos, project before-and-afters, milestone celebrations</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency alerts</strong> — "We are available for emergency [service] this weekend" during storms or emergencies</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What NOT to Post</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hard sales pitches ("Buy now! Limited time!")</li>
                <li>Posts that feel like ads rather than neighbor-to-neighbor communication</li>
                <li>Anything controversial or political</li>
                <li>Too-frequent posts (1-2 per month is the sweet spot for free posts)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Post Best Practices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Write like a neighbor, not a corporation. Casual, friendly tone.</li>
                <li>Include a photo — posts with photos get 3-5x more engagement</li>
                <li>Ask a question to encourage comments ("What is your biggest [industry] challenge?")</li>
                <li>Respond to every comment on your posts</li>
                <li>Share genuinely useful information, not just promotions</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Paid Advertising: Local Deals and Neighborhood Sponsorships</h2>

            <p>Nextdoor offers paid advertising options for businesses that want more reach. These tend to be surprisingly affordable compared to Google Ads or Facebook Ads.</p>

            <h3>Local Deals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Promoted offers that appear in the news feed of nearby neighborhoods</li>
                <li>You set your budget and targeting radius</li>
                <li>Pricing is typically cost-per-impression based</li>
                <li>Good for: seasonal promotions, new customer offers, event promotion</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Neighborhood Sponsorships</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your business is featured as the sponsor for specific neighborhoods</li>
                <li>Your logo and message appear at the top of the neighborhood page</li>
                <li>Builds long-term brand awareness in your target area</li>
                <li>Good for: building name recognition, establishing authority</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When to Use Paid vs Free</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start free</strong> — Set up your Business Page, get recommendations, and post regularly for at least 2-3 months</li>
                <li><strong>Test paid</strong> — If free posts are generating engagement and leads, test Local Deals with a small budget</li>
                <li><strong>Scale what works</strong> — Track which offers get the most responses and double down</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Responding to Recommendation Requests</h2>

            <p>The most valuable posts on Nextdoor for businesses are recommendation requests. These are posts like "Does anyone know a good landscaper?" or "Need a plumber ASAP — any suggestions?"</p>

            <h3>The Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Businesses can respond to recommendation requests in their category</li>
                <li>Your response appears alongside neighbor recommendations</li>
                <li>Be helpful and professional — do not be pushy</li>
                <li>Include your contact info and what makes you a good fit</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Effective Response Template</h3>
            <p>Here is a framework that works well:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Introduce yourself and your business briefly</li>
                <li>Mention relevant experience or specialization</li>
                <li>Reference your neighborhood connection ("We have served [neighborhood] for X years")</li>
                <li>Offer to help with a specific next step ("Happy to give you a free estimate")</li>
                <li>Include your phone number or website</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Keep it under 100 words. Neighbors appreciate brevity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Nextdoor and SEO: The Connection</h2>

            <p>Nextdoor does not directly impact your Google rankings the way Google reviews or backlinks do. But it contributes to your overall online presence in meaningful ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Citation signal</strong> — Your Nextdoor Business Page is another consistent mention of your NAP online, which contributes to <a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">citation building</a></li>
                <li><strong>Brand mentions</strong> — When neighbors mention your business in posts and recommendations, those are brand signals</li>
                <li><strong>Website traffic</strong> — Clicks from your Nextdoor page to your website generate referral traffic, which is a positive engagement signal</li>
                <li><strong>Review diversity</strong> — Having recommendations on Nextdoor alongside reviews on Google, Yelp, and Facebook shows Google your business is mentioned across multiple platforms</li>
                <li><strong>Local authority</strong> — Active participation in neighborhood conversations builds your reputation as a trusted local business</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Which Businesses Benefit Most from Nextdoor</h2>

            <p>Some businesses see better results on Nextdoor than others. Here are the categories that perform best:</p>

            <h3>Top Performers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Home services</strong> — Plumbers, electricians, HVAC, landscapers, painters, roofers, handymen. These are the most-requested categories on Nextdoor.</li>
                <li><strong>Contractors and remodelers</strong> — Homeowners constantly ask neighbors for contractor recommendations</li>
                <li><strong>Pet services</strong> — Veterinarians, groomers, pet sitters, dog walkers</li>
                <li><strong>Auto services</strong> — Mechanics, detailers, body shops</li>
                <li><strong>Real estate agents</strong> — Neighborhood expertise is your selling point, and Nextdoor IS the neighborhood</li>
                <li><strong>Restaurants and cafes</strong> — "Where should we eat tonight?" is a common Nextdoor question</li>
                <li><strong>Child care and tutoring</strong> — Parents on Nextdoor constantly ask for these recommendations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Good but Less Active</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Healthcare (dentists, chiropractors, doctors)</li>
                <li>Professional services (accountants, lawyers, financial advisors)</li>
                <li>Fitness (gyms, personal trainers, yoga studios)</li>
                <li>Retail (boutiques, specialty shops)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Common Nextdoor Marketing Mistakes</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Treating it like Facebook</strong> — Nextdoor users expect neighbor-to-neighbor conversation, not corporate marketing speak</li>
                <li><strong>Posting too often</strong> — Over-posting gets you flagged as spammy. 1-2 business posts per month is appropriate.</li>
                <li><strong>Being too salesy</strong> — Lead with helpful information, not discounts and promotions</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring recommendations</strong> — When someone recommends you, respond and thank them. Every time.</li>
                <li><strong>Not monitoring recommendation requests</strong> — Check Nextdoor regularly for people asking for your type of service</li>
                <li><strong>Inconsistent NAP</strong> — Your Nextdoor business name, address, and phone must match Google and your website</li>
                <li><strong>No photos</strong> — Business Pages without photos get far less engagement</li>
                <li><strong>Creating a personal account as your business</strong> — Use the official Business Page feature, not a personal profile</li>
            </ol>
