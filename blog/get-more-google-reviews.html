        <div class="blog-content reveal">

    <p>Here's a stat that should make every NH business owner pay attention: <strong>93% of consumers say online reviews impact their purchasing decisions</strong>, and Google reviews are the single biggest factor in local search rankings.</p>

    <p>If your business has fewer reviews than your competitors — or worse, no reviews at all — you're losing customers every single day. The plumber in <a href="/seo-manchester-nh.html">Manchester</a> with 47 reviews will always get picked over the plumber with 3 reviews, even if the second plumber does better work.</p>

    <p>The good news? Getting more Google reviews isn't complicated. You don't need fancy software. You don't need to bribe customers. You just need a system.</p>

    <p>Here are 9 strategies that actually work for local businesses in New Hampshire.</p>

    <h2>Why Google Reviews Matter More Than You Think</h2>

    <p>Before we dive into the strategies, let's be clear about why this matters:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local rankings:</strong> Google uses review count and quality as a major ranking factor for the <a href="/blog/google-maps-ranking-nh.html">Map Pack</a>. More positive reviews = higher position = more visibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Click-through rate:</strong> Businesses with 4.5+ star ratings get 28% more clicks from search results than businesses with lower ratings.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> 88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. In a close-knit state like New Hampshire, that's huge.</li>
        <li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Reviews provide social proof. When someone Googles "best dentist in Concord NH" and sees you have 60+ positive reviews, the decision is basically made.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1. Just Ask (Most Businesses Don't)</h2>

    <p>This sounds obvious, but it's the single most underused strategy. <strong>70% of customers will leave a review if you simply ask them.</strong> Yet most businesses never ask.</p>

    <p>The best time to ask is right after you've delivered great service — when the customer is happiest. For a restaurant, that's when the server drops off the check. For an HVAC company, that's right after a successful repair. For a dentist, it's at checkout.</p>

    <p>Keep it simple: <em>"If you had a good experience, it would really help us if you left a Google review. We're a small local business and reviews make a big difference."</em></p>

    <p>That's it. No pressure, no scripts, no awkwardness.</p>

    <h2>2. Create a Direct Review Link</h2>

    <p>The #1 reason customers don't leave reviews? It's too many steps. They have to Google your business, find your listing, scroll to reviews, click "Write a review"... and by step 3, they've given up.</p>

    <p>Fix this by creating a direct link that takes customers straight to the review form:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Go to your <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-tips.html">Google Business Profile</a></li>
        <li>Click "Ask for reviews" (or search "Google place ID finder")</li>
        <li>Copy the direct review link</li>
        <li>Shorten it with a service like bit.ly if needed</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now you have a one-click link you can put everywhere — emails, text messages, receipts, business cards.</p>

    <h2>3. Send a Follow-Up Email or Text</h2>

    <p>Timing matters. The best window for asking for a review is <strong>within 24 hours of the service</strong>. After that, the customer's enthusiasm fades and they move on with their day.</p>

    <p>A simple follow-up email works great:</p>

    <div style="background: var(--bg-surface); border: 1px solid var(--border); border-radius: var(--radius-lg); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <p style="margin: 0; color: var(--text-secondary); font-style: italic;">
            Subject: Thanks for choosing [Your Business]<br><br>
            Hi [Name],<br><br>
            Thanks for choosing us for [service]. We hope everything went great!<br><br>
            If you have a minute, a Google review would mean the world to us. It helps other [city] residents find us when they need [service].<br><br>
            [Leave a Review &rarr;] (link to your direct review URL)<br><br>
            Thanks,<br>
            [Your name]
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>Keep it short, personal, and include the direct link. Don't ask for a "5-star review" — that violates Google's policies and feels manipulative. Just ask for an honest review.</p>

    <h2>4. Add a Review Link to Your Email Signature</h2>

    <p>Every email you send is a chance to remind customers about reviews. Add a simple line to your email signature:</p>

    <p><em>"Love our service? <a href="#">Leave us a Google review</a>"</em></p>

    <p>This works passively — you're not asking anyone directly, but the link is always there. Over months, this adds up to a steady trickle of reviews.</p>

    <h2>5. Put QR Codes in Your Physical Location</h2>

    <p>If you have a physical storefront, office, or service vehicle, QR codes are gold. Create a QR code that links directly to your Google review page and put it:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>At your checkout counter or reception desk</li>
        <li>On receipts or invoices</li>
        <li>On business cards or thank-you cards</li>
        <li>On your service vehicle (for contractors, landscapers, etc.)</li>
        <li>In your waiting room</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A simple sign that says <em>"Enjoying your visit? Scan to leave a review"</em> with a QR code is surprisingly effective. Customers can do it right there on their phone while they're still in your space.</p>

    <h2>6. Respond to Every Single Review</h2>

    <p>This one is critical and most businesses skip it. <strong>Responding to reviews — both positive and negative — signals to Google that your business is active and engaged.</strong> It also encourages more reviews because customers see that the owner actually reads them.</p>

    <p>For positive reviews, keep it genuine:</p>

    <div style="background: var(--bg-surface); border: 1px solid var(--border); border-radius: var(--radius-lg); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <p style="margin: 0; color: var(--text-secondary); font-style: italic;">
            "Thanks so much, Sarah! We loved having you in. Hope to see you again soon!"
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>For negative reviews, stay professional and take it offline:</p>

    <div style="background: var(--bg-surface); border: 1px solid var(--border); border-radius: var(--radius-lg); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <p style="margin: 0; color: var(--text-secondary); font-style: italic;">
            "Hi Mark, we're sorry to hear about your experience. This isn't the standard we hold ourselves to. Please call us at [phone] so we can make this right."
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>Never argue with negative reviews publicly. Other potential customers are watching how you handle criticism.</p>

    <h2>7. Train Your Team to Ask</h2>

    <p>If you have employees, they need to be part of the review strategy. The person interacting with the customer at the point of service is in the best position to ask.</p>

    <p>Make it easy for them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Give them a simple script (see strategy #1)</li>
        <li>Print cards with the QR code they can hand out</li>
        <li>Recognize team members who generate reviews (gamify it)</li>
        <li>Make it part of the checkout or wrap-up process</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A dental office in <a href="/seo-nashua-nh.html">Nashua</a> we worked with went from 12 reviews to 85 in 6 months just by having the front desk ask every patient at checkout. No software, no incentives — just consistent asking.</p>

    <h2>8. Don't Ignore Other Platforms</h2>

    <p>While Google reviews should be your primary focus (they directly impact search rankings), don't ignore other platforms:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yelp</strong> — still important for restaurants, salons, and home services</li>
        <li><strong>Facebook</strong> — many NH customers check Facebook recommendations</li>
        <li><strong>Industry-specific sites</strong> — Houzz for contractors, Healthgrades for doctors, Avvo for lawyers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A strong presence across multiple review platforms builds overall trust and <a href="/services.html#local-seo">local SEO authority</a>.</p>

    <h2>9. Make It Part of Your Routine</h2>

    <p>The businesses that consistently get reviews don't run one-off campaigns. They build review collection into their daily operations.</p>

    <p>Here's a simple weekly routine that works:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monday:</strong> Send follow-up emails/texts to last week's customers</li>
        <li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Respond to any new reviews</li>
        <li><strong>Friday:</strong> Check review count vs. top competitors — are you closing the gap?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Consistency beats intensity. Five reviews per month, every month, for a year gives you 60 reviews. That's enough to dominate most local markets in New Hampshire.</p>

    <h2>What NOT to Do (Google Will Penalize You)</h2>

    <p>A few things to avoid:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Never offer incentives for reviews.</strong> No discounts, no freebies, no contest entries. Google's policies explicitly prohibit this, and they will remove reviews (or worse, suspend your profile) if they detect it.</li>
        <li><strong>Never buy fake reviews.</strong> Google's algorithms are increasingly sophisticated at detecting fake reviews. The penalty is severe — profile suspension or removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Never ask only happy customers.</strong> Review-gating (filtering out unhappy customers before they review) violates Google's policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Never review your own business.</strong> Google knows. It's not worth the risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Reviews Impact Your Local Rankings</h2>

    <p>Google's local algorithm weighs three main factors: <strong>relevance</strong>, <strong>distance</strong>, and <strong>prominence</strong>. Reviews are a massive part of prominence.</p>

    <p>Specifically, Google looks at:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Review count:</strong> More reviews = stronger signal</li>
        <li><strong>Average rating:</strong> 4.5+ is the sweet spot</li>
        <li><strong>Review recency:</strong> Recent reviews carry more weight than old ones</li>
        <li><strong>Review velocity:</strong> A steady stream beats a sudden burst</li>
        <li><strong>Keywords in reviews:</strong> When customers mention your services or city naturally, it helps rankings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is why review strategy is a core part of our <a href="/blog/local-seo-guide-nh.html">local SEO approach</a>. You can have perfect on-page SEO and a flawless <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-tips.html">Google Business Profile</a>, but if your competitor has 3x more reviews, they'll likely rank above you.</p>

    <h2>Start Today: Your 5-Minute Action Plan</h2>

    <p>Don't overcomplicate this. Here's what to do right now:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Create your direct review link</strong> (5 minutes)</li>
        <li><strong>Ask your next 5 customers</strong> for a review using the simple script in strategy #1</li>
        <li><strong>Respond to every existing review</strong> you haven't replied to yet</li>
        <li><strong>Add the review link to your email signature</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Set a weekly reminder</strong> to follow up on reviews</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you do just these 5 things, you'll see more reviews coming in within the first week.</p>
