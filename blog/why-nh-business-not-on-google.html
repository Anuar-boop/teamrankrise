    <p>Mike runs a plumbing business in Manchester, NH. He has 15 years of experience, a truck full of tools, and a handful of loyal customers who swear by his work. He even has a website — built back in 2019 — and a few five-star reviews on Google.</p>

    <p>But when someone in Manchester types "plumber near me" into Google, Mike's business is nowhere to be found. Not on page one. Not on page two. Not even in the Map Pack — the local results section that shows up at the top of the page with the little map pins.</p>

    <p>Instead, his competitors — companies with worse reviews and less experience — are getting all the calls. Mike is losing business every single day without even knowing it.</p>

    <p>Sound familiar?</p>

    <p>If you're a New Hampshire business owner and you're not showing up on Google, you're not alone. And it's costing you real money. According to BrightEdge, <strong>68% of all online experiences start with a search engine</strong>. For local businesses, the stakes are even higher: 76% of people who search for something nearby visit a business within a day, and 28% of those searches result in a purchase.</p>

    <p>The good news? In most cases, there are a handful of fixable reasons why your NH business isn't ranking. Let's walk through the 7 most common ones — and exactly how to fix each.</p>

    <h2>Reason 1: You Don't Have a Google Business Profile (Or It's Incomplete)</h2>

    <p>This is the single biggest reason New Hampshire businesses don't appear in local search results. If you don't have a Google Business Profile (GBP) — or if you claimed one years ago and never finished setting it up — you're essentially invisible to Google's local search algorithm.</p>

    <p>Here's why this matters so much: when someone in Concord, Nashua, or Portsmouth searches for "electrician near me" or "best coffee shop in Keene," Google displays a <strong>Map Pack</strong> at the top of the results. This is the box with three business listings, star ratings, and a map. According to research from Moz, the Map Pack captures roughly <strong>44% of all clicks</strong> on local search results pages.</p>

    <p>If you're not in the Map Pack, nearly half your potential customers will never see you.</p>

    <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://www.google.com/business/" rel="noopener">google.com/business</a> and either claim your existing listing or create a new one</li>
        <li>Verify your business (Google will send a postcard with a code to your physical address, or you may qualify for phone/email verification)</li>
        <li>Fill out <strong>every single field</strong> — business name, address, phone number, hours, website URL, service area, and business description</li>
        <li>Choose the right primary category. This is critical. If you're a heating contractor in Laconia, don't just pick "Contractor" — pick "HVAC Contractor" or "Heating Contractor." Google uses your primary category to decide which searches to show you for</li>
        <li>Add at least 10 high-quality photos: your storefront, your team, your work, your vehicles. Businesses with photos get 42% more requests for directions and 35% more click-throughs to their websites</li>
        <li>Write a keyword-rich business description. Instead of "We provide great service," try "Family-owned HVAC company serving Laconia, Meredith, and the Lakes Region since 2005. 24/7 emergency heating repair, furnace installation, and AC maintenance."</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="callout">
        <h4>NH-Specific Mistake</h4>
        <p>Many New Hampshire businesses that serve multiple towns (like a roofing company in the Seacoast region) set their service area too narrowly. If you serve Portsmouth, Exeter, Hampton, Dover, and Rochester, make sure all of those towns are listed in your GBP service area. Google uses this to match you with searches in those locations.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Reason 2: Your Website Isn't Mobile-Friendly</h2>

    <p>Here's a number that should concern every NH business owner: <strong>61% of Google searches now happen on mobile devices</strong>. In local search, it's even higher — people searching "restaurants near me" or "auto repair Manchester NH" are almost always on their phones.</p>

    <p>Google has used <strong>mobile-first indexing</strong> since 2019. That means Google primarily looks at the mobile version of your website — not the desktop version — when deciding how to rank you. If your site doesn't work well on a phone, Google will rank you lower. Period.</p>

    <p>This is a massive problem for New Hampshire businesses specifically. Many local businesses — contractors, dentists, restaurants, auto shops — had their websites built 5 to 10 years ago by a local web designer or a family member. Those sites often look fine on a desktop computer but are completely broken on a phone: text too small to read, buttons too close together, images stretching off-screen, menus that don't work.</p>

    <p><strong>How to check if your site is mobile-friendly:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Pull out your phone right now and visit your own website. Can you read the text without zooming? Can you tap the phone number to call? Can you navigate the menu easily?</li>
        <li>Use Google's Mobile-Friendly Test (search "Google mobile friendly test") — paste your URL and see if it passes</li>
        <li>Check Google Search Console under "Mobile Usability" for specific issues</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Common mobile issues we see on NH business websites:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Missing viewport meta tag</strong> — Your site needs <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</code> in the HTML head. Without this, mobile browsers render your site as a tiny desktop page</li>
        <li><strong>Fixed-width layouts</strong> — Sites built with a fixed 960px or 1024px width don't adapt to smaller screens</li>
        <li><strong>Tap targets too small</strong> — Buttons and links need to be at least 48x48 pixels so people can actually tap them with their fingers</li>
        <li><strong>Unplayable content</strong> — Flash elements (yes, some NH business sites still have them) don't work on mobile at all</li>
        <li><strong>Pop-ups that block the screen</strong> — Google specifically penalizes sites with intrusive interstitials (pop-ups) on mobile</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If your site fails the mobile test, this isn't something you can patch with a quick fix. You likely need a redesign with responsive design principles. The investment pays for itself quickly — a mobile-friendly site can dramatically increase your Google ranking and convert more visitors into customers.</p>

    <h2>Reason 3: Missing or Weak Meta Descriptions and Title Tags</h2>

    <p>When someone searches on Google, they see two main things for each result: the <strong>title tag</strong> (the blue clickable text) and the <strong>meta description</strong> (the gray text underneath). These are your business's first impression in search results — and for many NH businesses, they're terrible.</p>

    <p>We audit dozens of New Hampshire business websites every month, and here's what we see constantly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Title tags that just say "Home" or "Welcome" or the business name with no keywords</li>
        <li>Meta descriptions that are either completely missing, auto-generated by WordPress ("Just another WordPress site"), or stuffed with keywords that read like spam</li>
        <li>Every page on the site has the exact same title tag — Google sees this as duplicate content</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Your title tag is one of Google's most important ranking factors. It tells Google what your page is about. And your meta description, while not a direct ranking factor, determines whether people actually click on your result. A compelling meta description can double your click-through rate compared to a generic one.</p>

    <p><strong>Bad example (real NH business, anonymized):</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Title: "Home | Smith & Sons"</li>
        <li>Meta description: (none — Google pulled random footer text instead)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Good example (after optimization):</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Title: "Roof Repair & Replacement in Nashua NH | Smith & Sons Roofing"</li>
        <li>Meta description: "Trusted Nashua NH roofers since 1998. Storm damage repair, full roof replacement, and free inspections. Licensed, insured, 500+ five-star reviews. Call today."</li>
    </ul>

    <p>See the difference? The optimized version tells both Google and potential customers exactly what the business does, where they're located, and why they should click.</p>

    <p><strong>How to fix it:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Write a unique title tag for every page on your site. Keep it under 60 characters. Put your primary keyword at the beginning</li>
        <li>Write a unique meta description for every page. Keep it between 150-160 characters. Include a benefit and a call to action</li>
        <li>Include your city and "NH" in title tags for your main service pages. "Plumber in Manchester NH" is far more effective than just "Plumbing Services"</li>
        <li>If you're using WordPress, install Yoast SEO or Rank Math — these plugins make it easy to edit title tags and meta descriptions for every page and post</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Reason 4: No Local Keywords in Your Content</h2>

    <p>This is one of the most common issues we find when auditing NH business websites. Your site might describe your services perfectly well, but if it never mentions <strong>where</strong> you provide those services, Google has no reason to show you for location-based searches.</p>

    <p>Think about how your customers actually search. They don't just type "plumber." They type "plumber in Manchester NH" or "plumber near me" (and Google uses their location to determine "near me"). They type "best dentist Concord New Hampshire" or "emergency vet Nashua."</p>

    <p>If your website doesn't contain those geographic signals, Google won't connect you to those searches.</p>

    <p><strong>Where to add local keywords:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Title tags</strong> — "Emergency Plumbing Services in Manchester, NH | ABC Plumbing"</li>
        <li><strong>H1 headings</strong> — "Manchester NH's Trusted Emergency Plumber"</li>
        <li><strong>Body content</strong> — Naturally mention the cities and towns you serve throughout your page content</li>
        <li><strong>Image alt text</strong> — "ABC Plumbing van parked outside customer home in Bedford NH"</li>
        <li><strong>Footer</strong> — Include your full business address with city, state, and zip code</li>
        <li><strong>URL structure</strong> — Consider creating location-specific pages like /services/plumbing-manchester-nh/</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>NH-specific strategy:</strong> New Hampshire has unique geography that affects search behavior. The Seacoast region, the Lakes Region, the Upper Valley, the Monadnock Region, and the White Mountains are all distinct areas with their own search patterns. If you serve multiple regions, consider creating dedicated pages for each.</p>

    <p>For example, if you're an HVAC company based in Concord but you serve a wide area, create separate pages for:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>"HVAC Services in Concord, NH"</li>
        <li>"Heating Repair in Manchester, NH"</li>
        <li>"AC Installation in Nashua, NH"</li>
        <li>"Furnace Replacement in the Lakes Region"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each page should have unique content — not just the same text with the city name swapped out. Google can detect that kind of thin duplication and will penalize you for it. Write genuinely useful content about serving each area. Mention specific neighborhoods, landmarks, or common issues in that area (like old homes in Portsmouth's historic district that need specialized heating solutions, or lakefront properties in Meredith that have unique plumbing challenges).</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
        <p>Don't just target city names. Many NH residents search by region ("Seacoast NH plumber"), by county ("Hillsborough County electrician"), or by landmark-adjacent terms ("plumber near Merrimack Premium Outlets"). Think about all the ways your customers might describe your location and incorporate those naturally into your content.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Reason 5: Your Website Is Too Slow</h2>

    <p>Google has confirmed that <strong>page speed is a ranking factor</strong>. Slow websites rank lower than fast ones. And in 2026, with Google's Core Web Vitals firmly established as ranking signals, speed matters more than ever.</p>

    <p>How slow is too slow? Google recommends your main content loads within <strong>2.5 seconds</strong> (Largest Contentful Paint). If your site takes 5, 8, or 10+ seconds to load — which many NH business sites do — you're being penalized.</p>

    <p>But the SEO penalty is only part of the problem. Research shows that <strong>53% of mobile visitors will leave a site that takes more than 3 seconds to load</strong>. Every second of delay costs you customers.</p>

    <p><strong>Common speed killers on NH business websites:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unoptimized images</strong> — This is the number one issue. A single full-resolution photo from your iPhone can be 5-8 MB. Your entire homepage should ideally be under 2-3 MB total. We regularly see NH business sites with 20+ MB homepages because nobody compressed the images</li>
        <li><strong>Cheap shared hosting</strong> — Many NH businesses use the cheapest hosting plan they can find ($3-5/month shared hosting). These servers are overloaded and slow. Upgrading to quality hosting (SiteGround, Cloudways, or even managed WordPress hosting) can cut load times in half</li>
        <li><strong>Too many plugins</strong> — WordPress sites with 30+ plugins are sluggish. Every plugin adds code that needs to load. Audit your plugins and remove anything you're not actively using</li>
        <li><strong>No caching</strong> — Without browser caching, your site has to reload everything from scratch every time someone visits. A caching plugin (WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache) is a quick win</li>
        <li><strong>No CDN</strong> — A Content Delivery Network serves your site from servers geographically close to your visitors. For NH businesses, this means your site loads faster for visitors in New England</li>
        <li><strong>Render-blocking JavaScript</strong> — Scripts that load before the page content force visitors to wait. These should be deferred or loaded asynchronously</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How to check your speed:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" rel="noopener">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> and paste your URL</li>
        <li>Check both the Mobile and Desktop scores. Mobile is more important since Google uses mobile-first indexing</li>
        <li>Look at the "Opportunities" section — Google will tell you exactly what to fix and how much time each fix will save</li>
        <li>Pay special attention to LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), FID (First Input Delay), and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) — these are the Core Web Vitals that directly affect ranking</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A score below 50 on mobile means your site has serious speed issues. Between 50-89 is "needs improvement." You want to aim for 90+.</p>

    <h2>Reason 6: No Reviews or Social Proof</h2>

    <p>Google uses reviews as a significant ranking signal for local search. According to the annual Whitespark Local Search Ranking Factors study, <strong>review signals</strong> (quantity, velocity, and diversity of reviews) are among the top factors that determine Map Pack rankings.</p>

    <p>Here's the reality for many NH businesses: they have 0 to 5 Google reviews. Meanwhile, their competitors have 50, 100, or 200+ reviews. Google interprets this as a signal that the competitor is more established, more trusted, and more relevant — so they rank higher.</p>

    <p>Beyond Google's algorithm, reviews directly influence customer behavior. <strong>87% of consumers read online reviews</strong> for local businesses. If a potential customer in Dover is choosing between two landscaping companies — one with 3 reviews and one with 87 reviews — who do you think they're calling first?</p>

    <p><strong>Why NH businesses struggle with reviews:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>They don't ask. This is the number one reason. Most happy customers would gladly leave a review — they just need to be asked</li>
        <li>They make it too hard. Customers won't search for your business on Google and figure out how to leave a review on their own. You need to give them a direct link</li>
        <li>They ask at the wrong time. The best time to ask is immediately after delivering great service, while the positive experience is fresh</li>
        <li>They don't follow up. A single ask converts maybe 10-20% of customers. A polite follow-up doubles that</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How to build a review generation system:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Get your direct review link.</strong> Search for your business on Google, click "Write a Review," and copy that URL. You can also create a short link at <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/7035772" rel="noopener">Google's review link generator</a></li>
        <li><strong>Ask every satisfied customer.</strong> After completing a job, send a text message or email within 24 hours: "Hi [Name], thank you for choosing us! If you have a minute, a Google review would help us reach more families in [city]. Here's the link: [direct link]"</li>
        <li><strong>Make it dead simple.</strong> Print QR codes that link directly to your review page. Put them on invoices, business cards, receipts, and in your email signature</li>
        <li><strong>Respond to every review.</strong> Thank positive reviewers by name. Respond to negative reviews professionally: acknowledge the issue, explain what you've done to address it, and invite them to contact you directly. This shows future customers you care — and it signals to Google that your business is actively engaged</li>
        <li><strong>Never buy fake reviews.</strong> Google can detect them, and the penalty is severe — you could lose your entire Google Business Profile</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A realistic goal: aim for 2-3 new Google reviews per month. Within a year, you'll have a solid review profile that boosts your local ranking significantly. In smaller NH markets like Keene, Lebanon, or Claremont, even 20-30 genuine reviews can put you ahead of most competitors.</p>

    <h2>Reason 7: No Backlinks or Local Citations</h2>

    <p>Backlinks — links from other websites pointing to yours — are one of Google's oldest and most powerful ranking signals. Google sees each backlink as a "vote of confidence" for your website. The more high-quality sites that link to you, the more authoritative Google considers your site.</p>

    <p>For local NH businesses, there are two types of links that matter most: <strong>backlinks</strong> from relevant websites and <strong>citations</strong> (mentions of your business name, address, and phone number on directories and other sites).</p>

    <p>Most NH businesses have very few of either. They have a website that exists in isolation — nobody links to it, and it's not listed on any directories beyond maybe Yelp.</p>

    <p><strong>Essential citations for NH businesses:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Business Profile</strong> — Already covered above, but this is your most important citation</li>
        <li><strong>Bing Places for Business</strong> — Don't ignore Bing. It powers search on Alexa, Cortana, and DuckDuckGo</li>
        <li><strong>Apple Maps</strong> — Important for iPhone users asking Siri for nearby businesses</li>
        <li><strong>Yelp</strong> — Still a major citation source that Google cross-references</li>
        <li><strong>Better Business Bureau</strong> — BBB listings carry strong authority. Get your <a href="https://www.bbb.org/us/nh" rel="noopener">NH BBB listing</a></li>
        <li><strong>NH.gov Business Directory</strong> — Being listed on state government sites is a powerful trust signal</li>
        <li><strong>Your local Chamber of Commerce</strong> — The <a href="https://www.gnhcc.com/" rel="noopener">Greater Nashua Chamber of Commerce</a>, <a href="https://www.manchesterchamber.org/" rel="noopener">Manchester Chamber</a>, <a href="https://www.concordnhchamber.com/" rel="noopener">Greater Concord Chamber</a>, or whichever chamber covers your area. These memberships typically include a backlink from a high-authority local website</li>
        <li><strong>Industry-specific directories</strong> — HomeAdvisor, Angi, Thumbtack (for contractors), Healthgrades (for healthcare), TripAdvisor (for hospitality and restaurants)</li>
        <li><strong>Facebook Business Page</strong> — Not just for social media; it's a citation that Google indexes</li>
        <li><strong>LinkedIn Company Page</strong> — Another citation source with high domain authority</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How to build backlinks as an NH business:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Join local organizations.</strong> Chambers of commerce, Rotary clubs, BNI networking groups, and trade associations all have member directories with links</li>
        <li><strong>Sponsor local events.</strong> Sponsor a Little League team in Derry, a 5K in Exeter, or a community event in Plymouth. Event websites almost always link to sponsors</li>
        <li><strong>Get featured in local media.</strong> The Union Leader, NH Business Review, Seacoast Online, Nashua Telegraph, and Keene Sentinel all cover local business stories. Pitch yourself as a source for industry expertise</li>
        <li><strong>Create useful local content.</strong> Write a guide like "Complete Guide to Winterizing Your Home in New Hampshire" or "Best Family Activities in the White Mountains." Useful content naturally earns links</li>
        <li><strong>Partner with complementary businesses.</strong> If you're a roofer, partner with a local gutter company, siding installer, or realtor. Cross-link on your websites and refer customers to each other</li>

        <h4>Critical Rule: NAP Consistency</h4>
        <p>Your business Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP) must be <strong>exactly identical</strong> everywhere it appears online. If your website says "Johnson Plumbing, LLC" but your Yelp listing says "Johnson Plumbing LLC" (no comma), Google may treat these as different businesses. Even small inconsistencies — "St" vs "Street," "Ste 100" vs "Suite 100" — can hurt you. Pick one format and use it everywhere.</p>
