        <p>Backlinks — links from other websites pointing to yours — remain one of Google's top ranking factors. For local businesses in New Hampshire, the right backlinks can be the difference between sitting on page 3 and showing up in the Map Pack.</p>

        <p>But here's the problem: most backlink advice online is written for tech companies and national brands. It doesn't apply to a plumber in <a href="/seo-manchester-nh.html">Manchester</a> or a restaurant in <a href="/seo-portsmouth-nh.html">Portsmouth</a>.</p>

        <p>This guide covers 12 backlink strategies that actually work for local NH businesses — no purchased links, no spam, no shady PBNs.</p>

        <h2>Why Local Backlinks Matter More Than You Think</h2>

        <p>Not all backlinks are equal. For local SEO, a link from the Manchester Chamber of Commerce is worth more than a link from a random blog in another state. Here's why:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Geographic relevance</strong> — links from local websites tell Google your business is relevant to the NH area</li>
            <li><strong>Trust signals</strong> — links from established local organizations (chambers, newspapers, universities) carry high trust</li>
            <li><strong>Citation reinforcement</strong> — local links often include your <a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">NAP information</a>, strengthening your citation profile</li>
            <li><strong>Map Pack influence</strong> — Google's local algorithm weighs local backlinks heavily when determining <a href="/blog/google-maps-ranking-nh.html">Map Pack rankings</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>A handful of quality local backlinks will outperform hundreds of random directory submissions.</p>

        <h2>12 Proven Ways to Earn Local Backlinks in NH</h2>

        <h3>1. Join Your Local Chamber of Commerce</h3>

        <p>This is the easiest high-quality backlink you'll ever get. NH Chambers of Commerce include member directories on their websites — with a link to your site. The Manchester, Nashua, Concord, Dover, and Portsmouth chambers all have active online directories.</p>

        <p>Cost: $200-500/year depending on the chamber. Worth it for the backlink alone, plus networking benefits.</p>

        <h3>2. Get Listed in the NH Business Review</h3>

        <p>The NH Business Review (nhbr.com) is the state's leading business publication. Getting mentioned — even in a brief listing or event announcement — earns you a backlink from a highly authoritative local domain.</p>

        <p>How: Submit press releases about milestones (new hire, expansion, award), sponsor events they cover, or offer yourself as an expert source for industry articles.</p>

        <h3>3. Sponsor Local Events or Sports Teams</h3>

        <p>Local organizations almost always list sponsors on their websites. A $100-500 sponsorship of a Little League team, 5K race, school event, or charity fundraiser typically gets you a logo and link on the event page.</p>

        <p>Look for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Youth sports leagues in your city</li>
            <li>Community 5K runs and charity walks</li>
            <li>High school and college events</li>
            <li>NH nonprofit fundraisers</li>
            <li>Local festivals (Hampton Beach, Keene Pumpkin Festival, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Partner with Other Local Businesses</h3>

        <p>Find complementary (not competing) businesses and create reciprocal referral relationships. A <a href="/seo-nashua-nh.html">Nashua</a> real estate agent might partner with a home inspector, a mortgage broker, and a moving company — each linking to the others as "trusted partners."</p>

        <p>Keep it natural and relevant. A page of 50 random business links looks spammy. A "Partners We Recommend" page with 3-5 hand-picked businesses looks genuine — because it is.</p>

        <h3>5. Get Featured in Local Media</h3>

        <p>NH has several local media outlets that cover small business stories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>NH Union Leader</li>
            <li>Concord Monitor</li>
            <li>Foster's Daily Democrat (Dover)</li>
            <li>Seacoast Online (Portsmouth area)</li>
            <li>The Keene Sentinel</li>
            <li>Local Patch sites (Manchester, Nashua, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Newsworthy angles: opening a new location, reaching a milestone anniversary, hiring locally, community involvement, expert commentary on industry trends, surviving/thriving through economic changes.</p>

        <h3>6. Create a Local Resource Page</h3>

        <p>Build a genuinely useful resource on your website that other local sites would want to link to. Examples:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A home services company creates "The Complete Guide to Winterizing Your NH Home"</li>
            <li>A restaurant creates "NH Farm-to-Table: Local Farms and Producers We Partner With"</li>
            <li>An accountant creates "NH Small Business Tax Guide: State-Specific Deductions"</li>
            <li>A dentist creates "Emergency Dental Care in NH: What to Do When Your Dentist Is Closed"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When the content is genuinely useful and specific to NH, other local sites naturally link to it. This is the foundation of earning links instead of begging for them.</p>

        <h3>7. Leave Thoughtful Comments and Contribute to Forums</h3>

        <p>Not spammy "great post, check out my site" comments. Genuine, helpful contributions on:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>NH subreddit (r/newhampshire)</li>
            <li>Local Facebook groups (many NH cities have active business groups)</li>
            <li>Nextdoor discussions</li>
            <li>Industry forums relevant to your business</li>
        </ul>

        <p>While most forum links are "nofollow" (don't pass direct SEO value), they drive referral traffic and build brand awareness, which indirectly helps your SEO through increased search demand.</p>

        <h3>8. Offer Expert Quotes to Reporters (HARO/Connectively)</h3>

        <p>Connectively (formerly HARO — Help A Reporter Out) connects journalists with expert sources. Sign up for free, and you'll get daily emails with queries from reporters looking for quotes. When your quote gets published, you typically get a backlink.</p>

        <p>Focus on queries where your local expertise gives you an edge: "Looking for a [your industry] professional to comment on [topic]." Being specific about your NH experience makes your pitch stand out.</p>

        <h3>9. List on Industry-Specific Directories</h3>

        <p>Beyond general directories like Yelp and BBB, most industries have specialized directories that carry significant authority:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Home services:</strong> Angi, HomeAdvisor, Houzz, Porch</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Healthgrades, Vitals, Zocdoc, WebMD</li>
            <li><strong>Legal:</strong> Avvo, FindLaw, Justia, Martindale</li>
            <li><strong>Restaurants:</strong> TripAdvisor, OpenTable, Zomato</li>
            <li><strong>Automotive:</strong> RepairPal, AutoMD, CarTalk</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These directories have high domain authority, and listings often appear in Google search results on their own — giving you both a backlink and additional search visibility.</p>

        <h3>10. Build Relationships with Local Bloggers</h3>

        <p>NH has active food bloggers, lifestyle bloggers, and community bloggers. If you run a restaurant, invite a food blogger for a complimentary meal. If you're a home services company, offer a free service in exchange for an honest review.</p>

        <p>The key word is "honest." Don't ask for a positive review — ask for an honest one. Authentic content performs better and doesn't risk Google penalties.</p>

        <h3>11. Participate in UNH or Community College Programs</h3>

        <p>Universities and colleges have high-authority websites. Getting linked from a .edu domain carries extra weight with Google. Ways to get involved:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Offer internships and get listed on the career/internship page</li>
            <li>Speak at a business class or career event</li>
            <li>Sponsor a scholarship (even a small $500 scholarship gets a permanent .edu link)</li>
            <li>Participate in entrepreneurship programs or mentorship</li>
        </ul>

        <p>UNH, SNHU, Keene State, Plymouth State, and NH's community colleges all have business programs that welcome industry participation.</p>

        <h3>12. Reclaim Unlinked Mentions</h3>

        <p>Your business might already be mentioned online without a link. Google your business name (in quotes) and look for pages that mention you but don't link to your website. Then reach out and ask for the link.</p>

        <p>This has the highest success rate of any link-building tactic because the site owner already chose to mention you — they just forgot the link. A polite email asking them to add a link converts about 40-60% of the time.</p>

        <h2>What NOT to Do: Link Building Red Flags</h2>

        <p>Google has been penalizing manipulative link building since 2012. Avoid these:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Buying links</strong> — any service selling "100 backlinks for $50" will get you penalized</li>
            <li><strong>Private Blog Networks (PBNs)</strong> — fake websites created solely for link building. Google catches these regularly</li>
            <li><strong>Irrelevant directory spam</strong> — submitting to every random directory you can find</li>
            <li><strong>Link exchanges</strong> — "I'll link to you if you link to me" at scale looks unnatural</li>
            <li><strong>Guest posting on low-quality sites</strong> — articles on sites that exist only to host guest posts</li>
            <li><strong>Automated link building tools</strong> — any tool that promises automated backlinks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If someone offers you "guaranteed links" or promises a specific number of backlinks per month, run. Legitimate link building is relationship-based and takes time. Read our guide on <a href="/blog/how-to-choose-seo-agency-nh.html">choosing an SEO agency</a> to learn what to look for.</p>

        <h2>How Many Backlinks Do You Actually Need?</h2>

        <p>For local SEO in NH, you don't need hundreds of backlinks. Most local businesses ranking in the Map Pack have 20-50 quality backlinks. The key is quality over quantity:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>5-10 citation backlinks</strong> — Google Business Profile, Yelp, BBB, industry directories</li>
            <li><strong>3-5 local authority backlinks</strong> — Chamber of Commerce, local media, .edu sites</li>
            <li><strong>5-10 niche-relevant backlinks</strong> — industry directories, partner businesses, local bloggers</li>
            <li><strong>2-5 content-earned backlinks</strong> — from creating useful local resource content</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's 15-30 quality backlinks. Most NH businesses we audit have fewer than 10. Even getting to 20 quality backlinks puts you ahead of the majority of your local competitors.</p>

        <h2>A Realistic Monthly Link Building Plan</h2>

        <p>Here's what a sustainable local link building effort looks like:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Month 1:</strong> Claim all major directory listings, join your Chamber of Commerce, fix <a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">NAP consistency</a></li>
            <li><strong>Month 2:</strong> Create one local resource page, identify 3 potential business partners, sign up for HARO</li>
            <li><strong>Month 3:</strong> Sponsor a local event, pitch a local media story, reclaim 5 unlinked mentions</li>
            <li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Respond to 2-3 HARO queries per week, contribute to local forums monthly, nurture business relationships</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is 3-5 hours per month of focused effort. Not glamorous, but effective. Most <a href="/seo-concord-nh.html">Concord</a> and <a href="/seo-dover-nh.html">Dover</a> businesses we work with start seeing ranking improvements from link building within 2-3 months.</p>
