            <p class="intro-text">You're a plumber, electrician, house cleaner, or HVAC technician. You don't have a storefront — you go to your customers. Does that mean you can't rank on Google Maps or dominate local search? Absolutely not. Service area businesses (SABs) can rank just as well as brick-and-mortar locations. You just need a slightly different strategy.</p>

            <p>This guide covers everything unique about SEO for service area businesses — from GBP setup to content strategy to the common mistakes that keep SABs invisible online.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>What Is a Service Area Business?</h2>

            <p>Google defines a service area business as one that visits customers at their location rather than receiving them at a business location. Common examples:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Plumbers, electricians, HVAC technicians</li>
                <li>House cleaners, carpet cleaners, pressure washers</li>
                <li>Landscapers, lawn care, tree services</li>
                <li>Roofers, painters, general contractors</li>
                <li>Pest control, appliance repair</li>
                <li>Mobile mechanics, locksmiths</li>
                <li>Home health care, in-home pet care</li>
                <li>IT support, mobile notaries</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you operate from a home office, warehouse, or van — and your customers don't come to you — you're a service area business.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>GBP Setup for Service Area Businesses</h2>

            <p>The biggest difference between SABs and storefront businesses is how you set up your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a>.</p>

            <h3>Key Settings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hide your address</strong> — Toggle your address to hidden in GBP settings. Google shows your service area instead of a pin on the map.</li>
                <li><strong>Set your service area</strong> — Add the cities and towns you serve (up to 20). For NH, list your primary city + surrounding towns.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't use a PO Box or virtual office</strong> — Google's guidelines prohibit this. Use your actual home address (hidden) or a real office.</li>
                <li><strong>Primary category</strong> — Choose the most specific category possible. "Emergency Plumber" beats "Plumber."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Service Area Tips for NH</h3>
            <p>NH is small enough that many SABs serve a large portion of the state. However, <strong>don't set your service area to all of NH</strong> if you realistically only serve a 30-mile radius. Google rewards specificity. Better to list 8-10 specific towns you actually serve than claim the entire state.</p>

            <div class="table-wrapper">
                <table>
                    <thead>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>The SAB Ranking Challenge</h2>

            <p>Service area businesses face a unique challenge: the "distance" ranking factor works differently for you.</p>

            <p>For storefront businesses, Google uses their physical address to determine distance from the searcher. For SABs with hidden addresses, Google uses your general service area — which means you may not rank as well for <a href="/blog/near-me-search-optimization.html">"near me" searches</a> unless you compensate with stronger relevance and prominence signals.</p>

            <h3>How to Compensate</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>More reviews than competitors</strong> — If distance is harder to win, win on prominence instead. <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">More reviews</a> directly boost your ranking.</li>
                <li><strong>Location-specific content</strong> — Create pages for each town you serve to signal relevance</li>
                <li><strong>More citations</strong> — Get listed in more <a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">local directories</a> to strengthen your local signals</li>
                <li><strong>Active GBP</strong> — Weekly <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-posts.html">GBP posts</a> mentioning specific service areas</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Website Strategy for SABs</h2>

            <h3>Location Pages Are Essential</h3>
            <p>This is the single most important website strategy for service area businesses. Create a dedicated page for each primary town you serve:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>/plumbing-manchester-nh.html</code></li>
                <li><code>/plumbing-nashua-nh.html</code></li>
                <li><code>/plumbing-concord-nh.html</code></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each page should be unique — not just the same content with the city name swapped. Include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Specific services offered in that area</li>
                <li>Response times to that area</li>
                <li>Local landmarks or neighborhoods you serve</li>
                <li>Reviews from customers in that area</li>
                <li>Any area-specific considerations (well water issues in rural NH, older homes in Concord, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Read our full <a href="/blog/local-seo-for-multiple-locations.html">multi-location pages guide</a> for templates and best practices. Be careful to avoid <a href="/blog/duplicate-content-local-seo.html">duplicate content</a> across these pages.</p>

            <h3>Service Pages Are Your Money Pages</h3>
            <p>Create a <a href="/blog/service-pages-that-rank-convert.html">dedicated page for each service</a>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>/drain-cleaning.html</code></li>
                <li><code>/water-heater-repair.html</code></li>
                <li><code>/emergency-plumbing.html</code></li>
                <li><code>/bathroom-remodel.html</code></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each page targets a different keyword cluster and gives Google more reasons to show you for relevant searches.</p>

            <h3>Schema Markup for SABs</h3>
            <p>Use <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">LocalBusiness schema</a> with the <code>areaServed</code> property to tell Google exactly where you operate:</p>

            <pre style="background:#111215;padding:1rem;border-radius:8px;overflow-x:auto;font-size:0.85rem;color:#e8eaed;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.06);"><code>{
  "@type": "Plumber",
  "name": "Your Business Name",
  "areaServed": [
    {"@type": "City", "name": "Manchester, NH"},
    {"@type": "City", "name": "Bedford, NH"},
    {"@type": "City", "name": "Goffstown, NH"}
  ]
}</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Content Strategy for SABs</h2>

            <p>Your blog content should target three types of keywords:</p>

            <h3>1. Service + Location Keywords</h3>
            <p>"Emergency plumber Manchester NH," "HVAC repair Nashua," "house cleaning Concord NH." These are your money keywords — create <a href="/blog/keyword-research-local-seo.html">keyword-targeted</a> service and location pages for them.</p>

            <h3>2. Problem/Solution Keywords</h3>
            <p>"Why is my furnace making noise," "how to unclog a drain," "signs you need a new roof." These attract people in the research phase who will eventually need your services.</p>

            <h3>3. Seasonal Keywords</h3>
            <p>NH businesses have strong seasonal patterns. Follow our <a href="/blog/nh-seasonal-marketing-calendar.html">seasonal marketing calendar</a>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Frozen pipes, heating repair, ice dam removal, snow damage</li>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> AC tune-ups, spring cleaning, gutter cleaning, landscaping</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> AC repair, deck building, painting, pest control</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Furnace maintenance, winterization, leaf cleanup, chimney cleaning</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Reviews for SABs — Location Matters</h2>

            <p>When customers mention your service area in their reviews, it strengthens your local relevance. Encourage (don't script) location-specific reviews:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>"Great service in Manchester" is more SEO-valuable than "Great service"</li>
                <li>When <a href="/blog/respond-to-google-reviews.html">responding to reviews</a>, naturally mention the service area: "Thanks for choosing us for your HVAC service in Nashua!"</li>
                <li>Ask customers from different towns to leave reviews — geographic diversity in reviews helps you rank in more areas</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Target: reviews from at least 5-6 different towns in your service area. This signals to Google that you genuinely serve the entire area.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Common SAB Mistakes</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Showing your home address</strong> — Google may show it as a pin, which looks unprofessional and invites uninvited visitors. Always hide it for SABs.</li>
                <li><strong>Using a virtual office address</strong> — Against Google's guidelines. Can get your listing suspended.</li>
                <li><strong>Creating multiple GBP listings</strong> — One per business, not one per service area. Multiple listings create conflicts.</li>
                <li><strong>No location pages on website</strong> — The biggest missed opportunity. Your website should explicitly target every town you serve.</li>
                <li><strong>Copy-paste location pages</strong> — Identical content with only the city name changed. Google sees through this. <a href="/blog/duplicate-content-local-seo.html">Make each page unique</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Claiming too large a service area</strong> — Better to rank well in 10 towns than poorly in 50.</li>
                <li><strong>Not mentioning service areas on the website</strong> — If your site only says "NH" without listing specific towns, Google doesn't know where you actually serve.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>SAB vs. Storefront: Competitive Advantages</h2>

            <p>Being a service area business isn't just a disadvantage — you have some unique advantages:</p>

                            <th>SAB Advantage</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>Coverage</td><td>You can legitimately target more towns than a single-location business</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Flexibility</td><td>Expand or shift service areas without physical moves</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Content</td><td>More location pages = more keyword targets = more organic traffic</td></tr>

            <h2>The SAB SEO Checklist</h2>

            <p>Use this checklist to make sure you've covered all the SAB-specific optimization:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>GBP address hidden (show service area only)</li>
                <li>Service area set to specific towns (not too broad)</li>
                <li>All GBP fields complete (including <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-description.html">description</a>)</li>
                <li>Weekly GBP posts mentioning different service areas</li>
                <li>Location pages on website for each primary town</li>
                <li>Service pages for each core service</li>
                <li>LocalBusiness schema with <code>areaServed</code></li>
                <li>NAP consistent across all directories (<a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">NAP guide</a>)</li>
                <li>Reviews mentioning different service areas</li>
                <li>Blog content targeting seasonal + location keywords</li>
                <li>Citations in local directories for each service area</li>
                <li><a href="/blog/mobile-friendly-website-nh.html">Mobile-optimized website</a> with click-to-call</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Not having a storefront doesn't limit your SEO potential — in many ways, it expands it. You can target more locations, create more content, and reach more customers than a single-location business.</p>

            <p>The key: <strong>be explicitly local</strong>. Don't assume Google knows where you serve. Tell Google — through your GBP, your website, your schema, your content, and your reviews — exactly which towns benefit from your services.</p>

            <p>Start today: check that your GBP service area is set correctly, then create your first location page for your primary service town. That alone can significantly improve your visibility.</p>
