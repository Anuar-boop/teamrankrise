        <p class="lead">Your Google Business Profile description is 750 characters of prime real estate. Most businesses waste it with generic copy like "We provide quality services at affordable prices." Here's how to write a description that actually helps you rank higher and converts readers into customers.</p>

        <h2>Does Your GBP Description Affect Rankings?</h2>

        <p>Let's address this directly: <strong>Google has stated that the business description does not directly impact ranking.</strong> However, it matters for two important reasons:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Keyword relevance signals:</strong> Google highlights matching keywords in your description when they match a search query. This improves click-through rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Conversion impact:</strong> A well-written description convinces people to choose you over competitors. More clicks, calls, and visits send positive behavioral signals that do influence rankings over time.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Think of your description as a short sales pitch that happens to include relevant keywords naturally. Not a ranking hack — but a genuine competitive advantage.</p>

        <h2>Google's Rules for GBP Descriptions</h2>

        <p>Before writing, know the rules. Google will reject or edit descriptions that violate their guidelines:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Allowed</th>
                    <th>Not Allowed</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Services you provide</td>
                    <td>Phone numbers or URLs</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>What makes you unique</td>
                    <td>Promotional language ("Best deal!" "50% off!")</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Service area mentions</td>
                    <td>ALL CAPS text</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>History and background</td>
                    <td>Offensive or inappropriate content</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Specializations</td>
                    <td>Keyword stuffing</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Years in business</td>
                    <td>Misleading information</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>You have exactly <strong>750 characters</strong> (not words — characters, including spaces). Google displays the first ~250 characters before a "Read more" link, so front-load the important information.</p>

        <h2>The Formula: 4 Elements of a Strong Description</h2>

        <h3>Element 1: What you do (first sentence)</h3>
        <p>Lead with your primary service and location. This is the most important sentence because it appears before the "Read more" cutoff.</p>
        <p><strong>Template:</strong> [Business Name] provides [primary service] for [customer type] in [city/area], NH.</p>

        <h3>Element 2: What makes you different (sentence 2-3)</h3>
        <p>Why should someone choose you? Include your strongest differentiator: years of experience, specialization, certifications, or unique approach.</p>

        <h3>Element 3: Services list (sentence 3-4)</h3>
        <p>Naturally list your key services. This is where relevant keywords appear organically.</p>

        <h3>Element 4: Trust and credibility (final sentence)</h3>
        <p>End with something that builds confidence: licensing, awards, guarantee, or a simple commitment statement.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Keyword Strategy for Your Description</h2>

        <h3>Primary keywords to include naturally</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your main service:</strong> "plumbing," "dental care," "house cleaning"</li>
            <li><strong>Your city/area:</strong> "Manchester NH," "southern New Hampshire," "Seacoast area"</li>
            <li><strong>Specific services:</strong> "drain cleaning," "Invisalign," "deep cleaning"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Keywords to avoid forcing in</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"Near me" — Google doesn't match this in descriptions. See our <a href="/blog/near-me-search-optimization.html">"near me" optimization guide</a>.</li>
            <li>"Best" / "#1" / "top-rated" — promotional language that Google may flag</li>
            <li>Competitor names — against Google's guidelines</li>
            <li>Repetitive location names — "Manchester NH plumber Manchester New Hampshire" reads as spam</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Use the <a href="/blog/keyword-research-local-seo.html">keyword research</a> approach</h3>
        <p>Before writing, check what terms people actually search for your service in your area. Include those terms naturally — once each is enough.</p>

        <h2>Writing Tips for Maximum Impact</h2>

        <h3>Front-load the first 250 characters</h3>
        <p>Only the first ~250 characters show without clicking "Read more." Put your service, location, and strongest differentiator here. Don't waste it on "Welcome to our business" or "We're proud to serve."</p>

        <h3>Write for humans, not Google</h3>
        <p>Your description is read by people deciding whether to call you. Write naturally, clearly, and persuasively. If it sounds like a robot wrote it, rewrite it.</p>

        <h3>Include specific numbers</h3>
        <p>Numbers build credibility: "15 years of experience," "200+ five-star reviews," "serving 500+ families." Specifics are more believable than vague claims.</p>

        <h3>Mention what customers care about</h3>
        <p>Based on what customers commonly ask about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do you offer free estimates?</li>
            <li>Are you licensed and insured?</li>
            <li>What areas do you serve?</li>
            <li>Do you accept insurance?</li>
            <li>Are you available for emergencies?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Skip the generic filler</h3>
        <p>These phrases waste your 750 characters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"We provide quality services at affordable prices" — says nothing specific</li>
            <li>"Customer satisfaction is our #1 priority" — every business says this</li>
            <li>"Call us today for a free quote" — you can't include CTAs in descriptions</li>
            <li>"Welcome to [business name]" — wastes your most valuable characters</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Leaving it blank:</strong> 40%+ of businesses have no description. Any description beats no description.</li>
            <li><strong>Keyword stuffing:</strong> "Plumber Manchester NH plumber Nashua NH plumber Concord NH" will get flagged or ignored.</li>
            <li><strong>Including phone numbers or URLs:</strong> Google will reject these. Your phone and website are in separate GBP fields.</li>
            <li><strong>Using ALL CAPS:</strong> Looks spammy and violates guidelines.</li>
            <li><strong>Copying your website's about page:</strong> Write specifically for the GBP format — 750 characters, no links, no formatting.</li>
            <li><strong>Never updating it:</strong> If you've added services, moved locations, or changed your approach, update the description to match. Check our <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-tips.html">full GBP guide</a> for all optimization steps.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Quick Audit</h2>

        <p>Review your current description against this checklist:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Does the first sentence mention your primary service and location?</li>
            <li>Is it close to the full 750 characters? (Using less wastes opportunity)</li>
            <li>Does it include at least 3 specific services you offer?</li>
            <li>Does it mention what makes you different from competitors?</li>
            <li>Would a potential customer learn something useful from reading it?</li>
            <li>Is it free of phone numbers, URLs, and promotional language?</li>
            <li>Does it read naturally — not like a list of keywords?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you answered "no" to any of these, it's time for a rewrite.</p>

        <h2>Beyond the Description: Complete GBP Optimization</h2>

        <p>Your description is just one piece of your GBP. For maximum local visibility, also optimize:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Complete profile setup</a></li>
            <li><a href="/blog/google-business-profile-posts.html">Weekly GBP posts</a></li>

            <li><a href="/blog/respond-to-google-reviews.html">Review response protocol</a></li>
            <li>Photos (aim for 20+ high-quality images)</li>
            <li>Q&A section (answer common questions proactively)</li>
        </ul>
