        <div class="reveal">
            <p class="intro-text">It's 2 AM in January. A pipe bursts in a Manchester basement. The homeowner grabs their phone and searches "emergency plumber near me." The plumber who shows up first on Google gets a $500+ service call. The plumber who doesn't show up gets nothing — and never even knows the call existed.</p>

            <p>For plumbing and HVAC companies in New Hampshire, <a href="/blog/local-seo-guide-nh.html">local SEO</a> isn't optional — it's the difference between a phone that rings constantly and one that stays silent. This guide covers every strategy specific to getting plumbing and HVAC companies found on Google in NH.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Why Plumbers and HVAC Companies Need SEO</h2>

            <p>Home service businesses have the highest search intent of almost any local industry. When someone searches for a plumber or HVAC tech, they need help <em>now</em>. That urgency translates directly into calls and booked jobs.</p>

            <p><strong>The numbers tell the story:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>97%</strong> of consumers search online for local services before calling</li>
                <li><strong>"Near me" searches</strong> for home services have grown 150%+ year over year — see our <a href="/blog/near-me-search-optimization.html">near-me optimization guide</a></li>
                <li><strong>78%</strong> of local mobile searches result in a purchase within 24 hours</li>
                <li>The average plumbing job is <strong>$300-$800</strong>; a furnace replacement is <strong>$4,000-$8,000</strong></li>
                <li>One new customer per week from organic search = <strong>$15,000-$40,000+ per year</strong> in additional revenue</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Meanwhile, paid advertising keeps getting more expensive. HomeAdvisor leads cost $15-80 each, Google Ads for "plumber near me" in NH run $25-60 per click, and Angi membership fees keep climbing. <a href="/blog/small-business-seo-budget.html">Smart budgeting</a> means investing in SEO that builds lasting visibility instead of renting temporary ad placement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Top Keywords for local Plumbers &amp; HVAC Companies</h2>

            <p>Before optimizing anything, you need to know what your customers are actually searching for. Here are the highest-value keyword clusters for local plumbing and HVAC businesses:</p>

            <div style="overflow-x:auto;">
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Keyword</th>
                        <th>Est. Monthly Searches</th>
                        <th>Competition</th>
                        <th>Intent</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>plumber near me</td><td>8,100</td><td>High</td><td>Emergency/Immediate</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>emergency plumber [city] nh</td><td>320-590</td><td>Medium</td><td>Emergency</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>hvac repair near me</td><td>4,400</td><td>High</td><td>Emergency/Immediate</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>plumber manchester nh</td><td>480</td><td>Medium</td><td>Local hire</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>hvac nashua nh</td><td>390</td><td>Medium</td><td>Local hire</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>furnace repair nh</td><td>720</td><td>Medium</td><td>Seasonal/Urgent</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>ac repair concord nh</td><td>260</td><td>Low-Medium</td><td>Seasonal/Urgent</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>water heater replacement nh</td><td>210</td><td>Low</td><td>Research/Hire</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>frozen pipe repair nh</td><td>170</td><td>Low</td><td>Seasonal emergency</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>best plumber [city] nh</td><td>110-260</td><td>Low-Medium</td><td>Research/Compare</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>drain cleaning near me</td><td>3,600</td><td>Medium</td><td>Immediate</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>ductless mini split installation nh</td><td>140</td><td>Low</td><td>Research/Hire</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            </div>

            <p>Notice the pattern: the most valuable searches are <strong>emergency + location</strong> combinations. A homeowner with a burst pipe at midnight isn't comparison shopping — they're calling the first company they find. <a href="/blog/keyword-research-local-seo.html">Keyword research</a> for home services should prioritize these high-intent emergency terms.</p>

            <p>Also note the seasonal keywords. "Frozen pipe repair" spikes December through February in NH, while "ac repair" peaks June through August. Your content calendar should match these seasonal patterns.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Google Business Profile: Your #1 Priority</h2>

            <p>For plumbers and HVAC companies, <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-tips.html">your Google Business Profile</a> is the single most important ranking factor. When someone searches "plumber near me," the <a href="/blog/google-maps-ranking-nh.html">Map Pack</a> shows up above all organic results — and that's where most clicks go.</p>

            <h3>GBP Setup for Plumbing/HVAC</h3>

            <p><strong>Primary category:</strong> Choose the most specific category for your main service. If you primarily do plumbing, select "Plumber" — not "Home Services." If HVAC is your core, use "HVAC Contractor." Check our <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-categories-guide.html">complete GBP categories guide</a> for industry-specific recommendations.</p>

            <p><strong>Secondary categories</strong> to add:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plumber + Drain Cleaning Service + Water Heater Installation Service</li>
                <li>HVAC Contractor + Air Conditioning Contractor + Furnace Repair Service</li>
                <li>Add "Emergency Plumber" if you offer 24/7 service</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Service areas:</strong> Since most plumbers and HVAC companies travel to customers, you're a <a href="/blog/local-seo-for-service-area-businesses.html">service area business (SAB)</a>. Set your service radius to cover the cities you actually serve. In NH, a typical radius covers <a href="/seo-manchester-nh.html">Manchester</a>, <a href="/seo-nashua-nh.html">Nashua</a>, <a href="/seo-concord-nh.html">Concord</a>, and surrounding towns.</p>

            <h3>Photos That Get Clicks</h3>

            <p>Plumbing and HVAC companies often neglect GBP photos, which is a missed opportunity. Upload:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Before/after shots</strong> — clogged drain → clear drain, old furnace → new install</li>
                <li><strong>Your truck(s)</strong> — builds trust, shows you're a real business with branded vehicles</li>
                <li><strong>Team photos</strong> — customers want to see who's coming to their home</li>
                <li><strong>Equipment</strong> — modern equipment signals professionalism</li>
                <li><strong>Completed installs</strong> — new water heaters, mini splits, bathroom remodels</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Aim for 50+ photos on your profile. Companies with more photos get 35% more clicks to their website.</p>

            <h3>Reviews: The Trust Multiplier</h3>

            <p>Home services live and die by reviews. A plumber with 150 five-star reviews will always outperform one with 12 reviews, even if the 12-review plumber is technically better. Read our full guide on <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">getting more Google reviews</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Review strategy for plumbers/HVAC:</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ask at the moment of relief</strong> — right after you fix the problem, when the customer is most grateful</li>
                <li><strong>Text a review link</strong> — don't hand them a card; send a direct Google review link via SMS</li>
                <li><strong>Follow up next day</strong> — "Hi [Name], wanted to make sure your [drain/furnace/AC] is working well. If so, a quick Google review helps us help more homeowners like you."</li>
                <li><strong>Respond to every review</strong> — mention the specific service ("Glad we could get your furnace running before that cold snap!")</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Target: 5+ new reviews per week. In 6 months, you'll have 130+ reviews — likely more than any competitor in your area.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Website Must-Haves for Plumbing &amp; HVAC Sites</h2>

            <p>Your website needs to do two things: rank on Google and convert visitors into phone calls. Here's what works for home service sites:</p>

            <h3>Individual Service Pages</h3>

            <p>Don't list all services on one page. Create dedicated pages for each service:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Emergency Plumbing</li>
                <li>Drain Cleaning</li>
                <li>Water Heater Installation &amp; Repair</li>
                <li>Sewer Line Repair</li>
                <li>Bathroom &amp; Kitchen Plumbing</li>
                <li>Furnace Repair &amp; Installation</li>
                <li>AC Repair &amp; Installation</li>
                <li>Ductless Mini Split Installation</li>
                <li>Boiler Service</li>
                <li>Indoor Air Quality</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each page should target its specific keyword ("drain cleaning manchester nh"), include pricing guidance, and have a clear call-to-action. See our guide on <a href="/blog/service-pages-that-rank-convert.html">creating service pages that rank and convert</a>.</p>

            <h3>City-Specific Landing Pages</h3>

            <p>If you serve multiple cities (most NH plumbers do), create pages for each market:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>"Plumber in Manchester, NH" — mention Manchester neighborhoods, landmarks, common plumbing issues in older Manchester homes</li>
                <li>"HVAC Repair Nashua, NH" — reference Nashua's climate challenges, typical home sizes, heating costs</li>
                <li>"Emergency Plumber Concord, NH" — Concord-specific content, not just the same page with the city name swapped</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each city page needs unique content. Google penalizes thin duplicate pages with just the city name changed. Include local details — mention neighborhoods, landmarks, and specific challenges homeowners face in that area.</p>

            <h3>Conversion Elements</h3>

            <p>Your website visitors need to call you in seconds, not minutes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Click-to-call phone number</strong> — large, visible, on every page. On mobile, it should be one tap</li>
                <li><strong>24/7 emergency badge</strong> — if you offer emergency service, make it impossible to miss</li>
                <li><strong>Trust badges</strong> — licensed, insured, bonded. NH plumber license number visible</li>
                <li><strong>"Call now" sticky bar</strong> — fixed to bottom of screen on mobile</li>
                <li><strong>Response time promise</strong> — "On-site within 60 minutes" or "Same-day service guaranteed"</li>
                <li><strong>Pricing transparency</strong> — even ballpark ranges ("drain cleaning starting at $149") reduce friction</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Make sure your site loads fast — a homeowner with a flooded basement isn't waiting 8 seconds for your page to load. They'll hit back and call the next result. Read our <a href="/blog/website-speed-optimization.html">speed optimization guide</a>.</p>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Content Strategy: The Seasonal Calendar</h2>

            <p>Plumbing and HVAC businesses have massive seasonal search patterns in NH. Your content should match them:</p>

            <h3>Winter (December – February)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"How to prevent frozen pipes in NH" — searches spike during cold snaps</li>
                <li>"Signs your furnace needs repair" — November through January</li>
                <li>"Emergency heating repair [city]" — create pages before the season hits</li>
                <li>"How to winterize your plumbing" — October publish for November traffic</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Spring (March – May)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"AC tune-up checklist" — publish in March for April searches</li>
                <li>"Spring plumbing maintenance tips" — melting snow reveals pipe problems</li>
                <li>"Sump pump maintenance guide" — spring flooding season</li>
                <li>"Central air vs ductless mini split" — homeowners plan AC purchases</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summer (June – August)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"AC not cooling" — July peak searches</li>
                <li>"Emergency AC repair [city]" — pages should already exist and be indexed</li>
                <li>"Water heater replacement guide" — year-round but spikes in summer</li>
                <li>"Outdoor plumbing for deck/pool" — NH homeowners invest in outdoor living</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fall (September – November)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"Furnace tune-up before winter" — September/October publishing</li>
                <li>"How to prepare your home for local winter" — comprehensive guide</li>
                <li>"Boiler vs furnace: which is right for your NH home" — comparison content</li>
                <li>"Radiant floor heating cost" — renovation season content</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Publish seasonal content <strong>6-8 weeks before peak search demand</strong>. Google needs time to index and rank your pages. If you publish a frozen pipe article in January, it won't rank until February — too late.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>How to Outrank HomeAdvisor, Angi, and Thumbtack</h2>

            <p>These lead aggregators often dominate search results for home service keywords. Here's how to compete:</p>

            <p><strong>They have authority. You have relevance and locality.</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Target hyper-local keywords</strong> — HomeAdvisor ranks for "plumber near me" but struggles with "emergency plumber dover nh" or "frozen pipe repair keene nh." The more local and specific, the better your odds.</li>
                <li><strong>Dominate the Map Pack</strong> — lead generation sites can't appear in the Google Maps 3-pack. That's exclusively for local businesses. <a href="/services.html#gbp">Optimize your GBP</a> and you own space they literally cannot compete for.</li>
                <li><strong>Build local backlinks</strong> — links from NH-specific sites (NH Business Review, local chambers of commerce, town newspapers) carry more weight for local searches than the national links these platforms have. See our <a href="/blog/get-local-backlinks-nh.html">guide to getting local backlinks in NH</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Add <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">schema markup</a></strong> — LocalBusiness, Service, and Review schema help Google understand exactly what you do and where. Aggregators use generic markup; yours should be specific.</li>
                <li><strong>Create better content</strong> — your "drain cleaning in Manchester, NH" page can include specific details about Manchester's older sewer systems, local pricing, and before/after photos of actual jobs you've done in Manchester. HomeAdvisor can't match that.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The goal isn't to outrank them for every keyword — it's to surround them. When someone searches for plumbing/HVAC in your area, your website shows up in organic results, your GBP shows up in the Map Pack, and your name shows up in review sites. That multi-channel presence beats a single HomeAdvisor listing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Review Generation for Home Service Companies</h2>

            <p>Reviews are the lifeblood of plumbing and HVAC marketing. Here's a system that works:</p>

            <h3>The Post-Job Review System</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Complete the job</strong> and confirm the customer is satisfied</li>
                <li><strong>While still on-site:</strong> "Would you mind leaving us a quick Google review? It really helps other homeowners find reliable service." Hand them your phone with the review page open, or text them the link</li>
                <li><strong>2 hours later:</strong> Send a thank-you text with the direct review link</li>
                <li><strong>Next day:</strong> If no review yet, send a polite follow-up</li>
                <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> Email past customers a review request (batch your last 30 days of jobs)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>What to Do About Negative Reviews</h3>

            <p>Every plumber gets them — the customer who expected a $50 fix for a $500 problem, or the one who blames you for a pre-existing issue. The key:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Respond within 24 hours</strong> — professionally, empathetically, without being defensive</li>
                <li><strong>Take it offline</strong> — "We'd like to make this right. Please call us at (603) 605-8532 so we can discuss."</li>
                <li><strong>Never argue publicly</strong> — future customers read your responses, not the complaint. Your calm, professional response builds more trust than the negative review destroys.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A business with 200 reviews and a 4.7 rating is more trustworthy than one with 15 reviews and 5.0 stars.</p>

            <h2>8 Common SEO Mistakes Plumbers Make</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>No website at all</strong> — relying entirely on HomeAdvisor/Angi. You're renting someone else's platform and competing with every other plumber they list.</li>
                <li><strong>One-page website</strong> — a single page with all services listed. Google needs individual pages to rank for individual keywords.</li>
                <li><strong>No Google Business Profile</strong> — or a profile that was set up once and never updated. An incomplete GBP is almost as bad as no GBP.</li>
                <li><strong>Duplicate city pages</strong> — copying the same content and just swapping city names. Google catches this and may penalize all of them.</li>
                <li><strong>No reviews strategy</strong> — waiting for reviews to come naturally. They won't. You need a system.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring mobile</strong> — 73% of plumber searches happen on mobile. If your site isn't fast and easy to use on a phone, you're losing the majority of potential customers.</li>
                <li><strong>No emergency keywords</strong> — missing the highest-intent, highest-value searches. "Emergency plumber [city]" should be a dedicated page.</li>
                <li><strong>Paying for leads instead of investing in assets</strong> — $80/lead x 10 leads/month = $9,600/year renting leads. That same budget in SEO builds an asset you own forever.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>ROI: SEO vs. the Cost of One Job</h2>

            <p>Let's do the math for a typical NH plumbing/HVAC company:</p>

            <div style="overflow-x:auto;">
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Metric</th>
                        <th>Paid Leads</th>
                        <th>SEO (after 6 months)</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>Monthly cost</td><td>$1,500-$3,000</td><td>$800-$1,500</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Leads per month</td><td>15-30</td><td>20-50</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Cost per lead</td><td>$50-$200</td><td>$16-$75</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Close rate</td><td>20-30%</td><td>30-50%</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Jobs booked/month</td><td>4-9</td><td>8-25</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Asset value when you stop</td><td>$0 — leads stop immediately</td><td>Rankings persist 6-12+ months</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            </div>

            <p><strong>One furnace installation</strong> averages $4,000-$8,000. <strong>One bathroom remodel</strong> runs $8,000-$15,000. Even a basic drain cleaning at $200 pays for a significant chunk of monthly SEO investment.</p>

            <p>If SEO brings you just <strong>2 extra jobs per month</strong> at an average ticket of $500, that's $12,000/year in additional revenue from an investment of $9,600-$18,000. By month 8-10, SEO typically delivers positive ROI that compounds — because rankings build on themselves while ad costs only go up.

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>

            <p>SEO for plumbers and HVAC companies comes down to three things: <strong>be findable when emergencies happen, look trustworthy enough to get the call, and deliver great enough service to earn the review</strong>.</p>

            <p>NH's home service market is competitive but not saturated — especially outside <a href="/seo-manchester-nh.html">Manchester</a> and <a href="/seo-nashua-nh.html">Nashua</a>. Companies serving <a href="/seo-concord-nh.html">Concord</a>, Dover, Portsmouth, and the Lakes Region have real opportunities to dominate their local markets with consistent <a href="/services.html#local-seo">local SEO</a> work.</p>

            <p>Start with the checklist above. Focus on your GBP first — it's free and delivers the fastest results. Then build out service pages and city pages on your website. Add a review generation system. Publish seasonal content before the demand hits.</p>

            <p>In 6 months, you'll wonder why you ever paid $80 per lead for something you could generate for free.</p>
