            <p class="intro-text">One bad Google review can cost you $30,000 in lost revenue over a year. One viral complaint on social media can undo years of trust-building. Your online reputation is the most valuable — and most fragile — marketing asset your business has.</p>

            <p>This guide covers how to monitor what people are saying about your business, protect your reputation from damage, and actively build a positive online presence that drives customer trust and revenue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Why Reputation Management Matters More Than Ever</h2>

            <p>The numbers tell the story:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>93%</strong> of consumers say online reviews influence their buying decisions</li>
                <li><strong>87%</strong> won't consider a business with less than 3 stars</li>
                <li><strong>94%</strong> say a negative review has convinced them to avoid a business</li>
                <li>A one-star increase on Yelp leads to a <strong>5-9% increase</strong> in revenue</li>
                <li>Businesses with 4.0-4.5 stars earn <strong>28% more</strong> revenue than those below 4.0</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your reputation directly impacts your <a href="/blog/google-local-pack-ranking.html">Local Pack ranking</a> too. Reviews are the third most important ranking factor — meaning a strong reputation doesn't just build trust, it makes you more visible.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>The 5 Pillars of Reputation Management</h2>

            <h3>1. Monitor — Know What's Being Said</h3>
            <p>You can't manage what you don't see. Set up monitoring for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Reviews</strong> — Check your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a> daily</li>
                <li><strong>Yelp, Facebook, BBB</strong> — Check weekly</li>
                <li><strong>Industry-specific sites</strong> — Healthgrades, Angi, Avvo, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Social media mentions</strong> — Search your business name on Facebook groups, Nextdoor</li>
                <li><strong>Google Alerts</strong> — Set up free alerts for your business name</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Free Monitoring Setup (15 Minutes)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to google.com/alerts</li>
                <li>Create an alert for your exact business name (in quotes)</li>
                <li>Create an alert for your business name + common misspellings</li>
                <li>Set delivery to "as it happens" for email notifications</li>
                <li>Turn on Google Business Profile notifications in the GBP app</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>2. Respond — Never Leave Reviews Unanswered</h3>
            <p>Every review deserves a response — positive and negative. Here's the framework:</p>

            <div class="table-wrapper">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Review Type</th>
                            <th>Response Time</th>
                            <th>Approach</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>5-star positive</td><td>Within 24 hours</td><td>Thank them, mention something specific, invite back</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>4-star positive</td><td>Within 24 hours</td><td>Thank them, acknowledge the gap, offer to improve</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>3-star neutral</td><td>Within 12 hours</td><td>Thank them, ask for specifics, offer resolution privately</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>1-2 star negative</td><td>Within 4 hours</td><td>Apologize, take responsibility, move offline to resolve</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Fake/spam</td><td>Within 24 hours</td><td>Flag for removal, respond professionally</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>

            <h3>3. Generate — Build a Steady Stream of Positive Reviews</h3>
            <p>The best defense against negative reviews is a mountain of positive ones. A single 1-star review against 200 5-star reviews barely moves the needle.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Ask every satisfied customer for a review (in person, email, text)</li>
                <li>Make it easy — send a direct Google review link</li>
                <li>Time it right — ask when satisfaction is highest (right after a compliment)</li>
                <li>Follow up once — a gentle reminder 3 days later if they haven't left one</li>
                <li>Never offer incentives for reviews (against Google's guidelines)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Our guides: <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">getting more reviews</a> and the <a href="/blog/first-50-google-reviews.html">first 50 reviews playbook</a>.</p>

            <h3>4. Protect — Prevent Reputation Damage</h3>
            <p>Prevention is cheaper than recovery. Protect your reputation by:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delivering consistently</strong> — Most negative reviews come from genuinely bad experiences</li>
                <li><strong>Setting expectations</strong> — Underpromise, overdeliver. Mismatched expectations cause complaints.</li>
                <li><strong>Following up proactively</strong> — Call after service to check satisfaction before they leave a review</li>
                <li><strong>Training your team</strong> — Every employee interaction is a potential review</li>
                <li><strong>Handling complaints immediately</strong> — An unhappy customer who gets resolved rarely leaves a negative review</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Improve — Use Feedback to Get Better</h3>
            <p>Your reviews are free market research. Look for patterns:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Multiple complaints about wait times? Fix your scheduling.</li>
                <li>Praise for a specific employee? Recognize them and replicate what they do.</li>
                <li>Questions about pricing? Add clearer pricing to your website.</li>
                <li>Mentions of competitors? Study what they're doing differently.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The businesses that treat reviews as feedback (not just marketing) are the ones that actually improve. Improvement leads to more positive reviews, which leads to more customers — a virtuous cycle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Platform-by-Platform Strategy</h2>

            <h3>Google Reviews (Priority #1)</h3>
            <p>Google Reviews directly impact your <a href="/blog/google-local-pack-ranking.html">Local Pack ranking</a>. This is where most customers look first.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Target: 4.5+ star average with steady monthly flow</li>
                <li>Respond to 100% of reviews</li>
                <li>Use <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-posts.html">GBP Posts</a> to share positive reviews</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Yelp</h3>
            <p>Yelp has strict review filtering. Don't ask for Yelp reviews directly (they filter those out). Instead, deliver great service and let Yelp reviews come naturally.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Claim and complete your Yelp business page</li>
                <li>Respond to every review (especially negatives)</li>
                <li>Add photos and business info</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Facebook</h3>
            <p>Facebook Recommendations (the thumbs up/down system) are less impactful than Google but still visible. More importantly, Facebook is where local word-of-mouth happens.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Turn on Recommendations on your Facebook page</li>
                <li>Be active in local Facebook groups (helpful, not promotional)</li>
                <li>Respond to comments and messages promptly</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Industry-Specific Sites</h3>
            <p>Claim your profile and respond to reviews on whatever platform your industry uses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Home services:</strong> Angi, HomeAdvisor, Houzz</li>
                <li><strong>Medical:</strong> Healthgrades, Zocdoc, Vitals</li>
                <li><strong>Legal:</strong> Avvo, FindLaw, Lawyers.com</li>
                <li><strong>Automotive:</strong> CarFax, RepairPal</li>
                <li><strong>Restaurants:</strong> TripAdvisor, OpenTable</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Handling a Reputation Crisis</h2>

            <p>Sometimes things go wrong — a viral complaint, a wave of negative reviews, or unfair media coverage. Here's the crisis playbook:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Don't Panic (and Don't Delete)</h3>
            <p>Your first instinct will be to delete, deny, or fight back. Resist all three. Deleting comments looks like a cover-up. Denial escalates. Fighting back creates entertainment for observers.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Acknowledge Publicly</h3>
            <p>Respond publicly with empathy and accountability. Use this template:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Thank you for bringing this to our attention."</li>
                <li>"We take this seriously and are looking into it."</li>
                <li>"We'd like to make this right. Please contact [name] at [phone/email]."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Resolve Privately</h3>
            <p>Move the conversation offline. Call the customer, listen, and offer a genuine resolution. Most angry customers just want to be heard.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Follow Up Publicly</h3>
            <p>After resolution, add a public follow-up: "We reached out to this customer and resolved the issue. We've also [specific improvement you made] to prevent this in the future."</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Dilute with Positivity</h3>
            <p>After resolving the crisis, accelerate your positive review collection. The best antidote to negative press is an overwhelming volume of positive experiences.</p>

            <h2>Reputation Metrics to Track</h2>

            <div class="table-wrapper">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>

            <h2>Reputation Management for NH Businesses</h2>

            <p>New Hampshire has some unique characteristics that affect reputation management:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Small communities</strong> — Word travels fast in NH towns. One great experience (or bad one) gets shared quickly in local circles, Facebook groups, and Nextdoor.</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonal fluctuations</strong> — Tourism-dependent businesses (lakes region, ski country) see review spikes in season. Make sure you're <a href="/blog/nh-seasonal-marketing-calendar.html">prepared for peak periods</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Loyalty matters</strong> — NH residents value relationships. A business that responds personally to every review builds community loyalty that competitors can't buy.</li>
                <li><strong>Local media</strong> — NH Business Review, Union Leader, and local community papers are all potential amplifiers of both positive and negative stories.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In a state this small, your reputation IS your marketing. <a href="/blog/build-trust-online-small-business.html">Building trust online</a> translates directly to real-world word-of-mouth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>The Weekly Reputation Routine (30 Minutes)</h2>

            <p>Reputation management doesn't require hours per week. Here's a 30-minute weekly routine:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Monday (10 min):</strong> Check and respond to all new Google reviews</li>
                <li><strong>Monday (5 min):</strong> Check Yelp, Facebook, and industry sites for new reviews</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday (5 min):</strong> Review Google Alerts for any new mentions</li>
                <li><strong>Friday (10 min):</strong> Send review request emails/texts to this week's customers</li>
            </ol>

            <p>That's it. Consistency beats intensity. A business that spends 30 minutes every week on reputation will outperform one that does a 10-hour crisis management session once a year.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Common Reputation Mistakes</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Buying fake reviews</strong> — Google detects and removes them. You can also get your entire listing suspended. Never worth it.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring negative reviews</strong> — Silence looks like you don't care</li>
                <li><strong>Getting defensive in responses</strong> — Never argue with a reviewer publicly</li>
                <li><strong>Only asking happy customers</strong> — Ask everyone; unhappy customers who feel heard often change their review</li>
                <li><strong>Set-it-and-forget-it</strong> — Reputation needs ongoing attention, not one-time setup</li>
                <li><strong>Obsessing over one bad review</strong> — Focus on the overall trend, not individual reviews</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Your online reputation is built one interaction at a time — and it compounds. Every positive review makes the next one easier to get. Every prompt response shows future customers you care. Every resolved complaint demonstrates integrity.</p>

            <p>The formula is simple: <strong>deliver great service → ask for reviews → respond to everything → learn from feedback → improve</strong>. Do this consistently, and your reputation becomes a competitive advantage that's nearly impossible for competitors to replicate.</p>

            <p>Start today: check your Google reviews, respond to any you've missed, and send a review request to your last 5 customers. That's 15 minutes that could change your business.</p>
