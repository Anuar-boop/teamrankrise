            <p>You worked hard to <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">get those Google reviews</a>. Now what? Every review — positive or negative — is a conversation happening in public. How you respond shapes how future customers see your business.</p>
            <p>Here's the thing most NH business owners miss: <strong>Google has confirmed that responding to reviews improves your local ranking</strong>. It's not just about politeness — it's an SEO signal. Businesses that respond to reviews rank higher in the <a href="/blog/google-maps-ranking-nh.html">Google Maps pack</a>.</p>
            <p>This guide gives you exact templates, timing strategies, and the mistakes that can cost you customers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Why Responding to Reviews Matters</h2>
            <p>Beyond the SEO benefit, here's what the data shows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>89% of consumers</strong> read business responses to reviews before choosing a company</li>
                <li><strong>45% of consumers</strong> say they're more likely to visit a business that responds to negative reviews</li>
                <li><strong>Responding within 24 hours</strong> is seen as the benchmark for good service</li>
                <li>Review responses are <strong>visible in Google Search results</strong> — not just Google Maps</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think of every review response as a mini-advertisement. You're not just talking to the reviewer — you're talking to every potential customer who reads it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>How to Respond to Positive Reviews (5-Star)</h2>
            <p>Most businesses either ignore positive reviews or post a generic "Thanks!" That's a missed opportunity. A good response to a positive review:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Thanks the reviewer by name</strong> — personalization shows you care</li>
                <li><strong>References something specific</strong> they mentioned — proves you actually read it</li>
                <li><strong>Includes a keyword naturally</strong> — helps your local SEO</li>
                <li><strong>Invites them back</strong> — encourages repeat business</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Template: Positive Review Response</h3>
            <div style="background:rgba(16,185,129,0.08);border:1px solid rgba(16,185,129,0.2);border-radius:12px;padding:1.5rem;margin:1.5rem 0">
                <p style="margin:0;line-height:1.8"><strong>Bad:</strong> "Thanks for the review!"</p>
                <p style="margin:1rem 0 0;line-height:1.8"><strong>Good:</strong> "Thank you, [Name]! We're glad the [specific service] worked out well for your [home/business]. Our team takes pride in [related quality]. We'd love to help with your [related need] anytime — just give us a call!"</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Real Examples by Industry</h3>

            <p><strong>Plumber:</strong></p>
            <p style="padding-left:1rem;border-left:2px solid rgba(16,185,129,0.3)">"Thank you, Sarah! We're thrilled that the emergency pipe repair went smoothly. Our plumbing team in Manchester knows how stressful a burst pipe can be, especially in a New Hampshire winter. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything else — we're always here for our neighbors."</p>

            <p><strong>Restaurant:</strong></p>
            <p style="padding-left:1rem;border-left:2px solid rgba(16,185,129,0.3)">"Thanks so much, Mike! Glad you enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese — it's our chef's favorite too. Next time you're in Nashua, try the seasonal special. We'd love to see you again!"</p>

            <p><strong>Dentist:</strong></p>
            <p style="padding-left:1rem;border-left:2px solid rgba(16,185,129,0.3)">"Thank you for the kind words, Jennifer! We know dental visits can be stressful, so we're glad our Concord team made you feel comfortable. See you at your next cleaning!"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>How to Respond to 4-Star Reviews</h2>
            <p>Four-star reviews are tricky. The customer is happy but not thrilled. Your response should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Thank them warmly (don't ask "what could we do better?" — that sounds defensive)</li>
                <li>Reinforce the positive things they mentioned</li>
                <li>Invite them back with enthusiasm</li>
            </ul>
            <div style="background:rgba(16,185,129,0.08);border:1px solid rgba(16,185,129,0.2);border-radius:12px;padding:1.5rem;margin:1.5rem 0">
                <p style="margin:0;line-height:1.8"><strong>Template:</strong> "Thanks, [Name]! We're happy you had a great experience with [specific detail]. Our [service type] team in [city] strives to deliver the best results. We'd love the chance to earn that 5th star next time!"</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>How to Respond to Negative Reviews (1-3 Stars)</h2>
            <p>This is where most businesses panic. Take a breath. A thoughtful response to a negative review can actually <strong>win you more customers</strong> than a positive review alone. Here's the framework:</p>

            <h3>The HEARD Method</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>H — Hear them.</strong> Acknowledge their frustration without being defensive</li>
                <li><strong>E — Empathize.</strong> Show you understand why they're upset</li>
                <li><strong>A — Apologize.</strong> Even if you disagree, apologize for their experience</li>
                <li><strong>R — Resolve.</strong> Explain what you're doing to fix it or offer to make it right</li>
                <li><strong>D — Direct.</strong> Move the conversation offline with a phone number or email</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Template: Negative Review Response</h3>
            <div style="background:rgba(245,158,11,0.08);border:1px solid rgba(245,158,11,0.2);border-radius:12px;padding:1.5rem;margin:1.5rem 0">
                <p style="margin:0;line-height:1.8">"[Name], thank you for sharing your experience. We're sorry to hear that [acknowledge specific issue]. That's not the standard we hold ourselves to at [Business Name]. We'd like to make this right — could you call us at [phone] or email [email] so we can discuss this directly? We value your feedback and want to ensure every customer has a positive experience."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Real Examples</h3>

            <p><strong>Slow service complaint:</strong></p>
            <p style="padding-left:1rem;border-left:2px solid rgba(245,158,11,0.3)">"David, we appreciate your honest feedback. We understand how frustrating a long wait time can be, and we sincerely apologize. We've since added a second technician to our Dover team to reduce wait times. We'd love the opportunity to show you improved service — please reach out to us at (603) 555-0123."</p>

            <p><strong>Pricing complaint:</strong></p>
            <p style="padding-left:1rem;border-left:2px solid rgba(245,158,11,0.3)">"Lisa, thank you for your feedback. We understand price is an important factor. Our pricing reflects the quality materials and licensed professionals we use for every job in Portsmouth. We'd be happy to walk through the invoice with you — please call us at (603) 555-0456 so we can make sure everything is clear."</p>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>What to NEVER Say in a Review Response</h2>
            <p>These mistakes can permanently damage your reputation:</p>

            <div style="background:rgba(239,68,68,0.08);border:1px solid rgba(239,68,68,0.2);border-radius:12px;padding:1.5rem;margin:1.5rem 0">
                <ul style="margin:0">
                    <li><strong>"That never happened"</strong> — Even if true, it looks defensive. Other readers side with the reviewer.</li>
                    <li><strong>"You're wrong"</strong> — Never argue facts publicly. Take it offline.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sharing personal details</strong> — Never reveal the customer's account info, purchase details, or anything private. This can violate laws.</li>
                    <li><strong>"We've never had this complaint before"</strong> — Implies the reviewer is lying or overreacting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Copy-pasted responses</strong> — Using the exact same response on every review looks robotic and uncaring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Getting emotional or sarcastic</strong> — Screenshots last forever. One angry response can go viral.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blaming the customer</strong> — Even indirectly. "If you had told us sooner..." puts them on defense.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>How to Handle Fake or Spam Reviews</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, fake reviews happen — sometimes from competitors, sometimes from people who never visited your business. Here's your action plan:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Don't respond emotionally.</strong> Post a calm, professional response: "We have no record of this visit. Please contact us at [phone] so we can look into this."</li>
                <li><strong>Flag the review.</strong> In your <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">Google Business Profile</a>, click the three dots on the review → "Report review"</li>
                <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Screenshot the review, note the date, and keep records in case you need to escalate</li>
                <li><strong>Request removal through Google support.</strong> If the review violates Google's policies (hate speech, spam, conflict of interest), submit a removal request</li>
                <li><strong>Bury it with legitimate reviews.</strong> The best defense is a steady stream of <a href="/blog/first-50-google-reviews.html">real 5-star reviews</a></li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Review Response Checklist</h2>
            <p>Use this for every review response:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Used the reviewer's name</li>
                <li>Referenced something specific from their review</li>
                <li>Included a relevant keyword naturally (service + city)</li>
                <li>Kept it under 100 words (people scan, not read)</li>
                <li>Ended with an invitation (come back, call us, etc.)</li>
                <li>Proofread for typos and tone</li>
                <li>Response is unique (not copy-pasted from another review)</li>
                <li>For negative reviews: offered to take it offline with contact info</li>

            <p>Beyond customer relations, responding to reviews directly helps your <a href="/blog/local-seo-guide-nh.html">local SEO</a>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keyword injection:</strong> Naturally including "plumber in Manchester NH" in your response adds relevance signals</li>
                <li><strong>Fresh content signal:</strong> Google sees activity on your profile as a sign of an active, engaged business</li>
                <li><strong>Increased engagement:</strong> Responses encourage more reviews — a virtuous cycle that boosts your <a href="/blog/online-reviews-local-seo.html">review profile</a></li>
                <li><strong>Click-through rates:</strong> Profiles with owner responses get more clicks from search results</li>
