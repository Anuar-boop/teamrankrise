            <p class="intro-text">Running 2+ locations? SEO gets exponentially harder. Each location needs its own strategy — separate Google Business Profile listings, unique local pages, consistent business information across directories. Mess up the structure, and your locations cannibalize each other in rankings. Get it right, and you own search results across your entire service area.</p>

            <p>This guide covers everything from website structure to managing multiple GBP listings to avoiding the most common multi-location SEO mistakes that tank rankings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>The Multi-Location SEO Challenge</h2>

            <p>Multi-location SEO isn't just local SEO scaled up. It introduces a whole new layer of complexity:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Duplicate content risk:</strong> If all your location pages are nearly identical, Google sees them as low-quality duplicate content and ranks them poorly.</li>
                <li><strong>Cannibalization:</strong> Your Boston location page competes with your New York location page for the same search terms, and neither ranks well.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple GBP listings:</strong> Each needs separate verification, unique photos, location-specific posts, and individual review management.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent NAP:</strong> Name, address, phone must match exactly across Google, Yelp, Facebook, Apple Maps, Bing, and 100+ industry directories. One typo kills trust signals.</li>
                <li><strong>Location-specific reviews:</strong> Managing reviews at scale — responding to each location's reviews, encouraging location-specific submissions — is resource-intensive.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The upside? When executed correctly, multi-location SEO is a moat. Small competitors with one location can't compete against you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Setting Up Your Website Structure</h2>

            <p>The foundation of multi-location SEO is your website architecture. You have three main options:</p>

            <h3>Option 1: Subdirectories (Recommended)</h3>
            <p>Each location gets a subdirectory: <code>example.com/locations/boston/</code>, <code>example.com/locations/new-york/</code></p>

            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> All locations benefit from your main domain authority. One site to manage. Google treats all locations as part of one business. Shared hosting infrastructure.</p>

            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires careful internal linking to avoid cannibalization.</p>

            <h3>Option 2: Subdomains</h3>
            <p>Each location gets a subdomain: <code>boston.example.com</code>, <code>newyork.example.com</code></p>

            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Clear separation between locations. Easy to hand off to franchisees or local managers.</p>

            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Subdomains don't share domain authority as effectively as subdirectories. More complex to manage.</p>

            <h3>Option 3: Separate Domains</h3>
            <p>Each location gets its own domain: <code>bostonexample.com</code>, <code>newyorkexample.com</code></p>

            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Maximum local relevance signals. Each location can have its own brand.</p>

            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive. Hard to manage. No domain authority sharing. Most expensive option.</p>

            <p><strong>For almost all businesses, subdirectories are the winning move.</strong> They're easiest to manage and most effective from an SEO standpoint.</p>

            <h3>Location Page Template</h3>
            <p>Each location page should have unique content — don't just swap city names:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Unique introduction specific to that location</li>
                <li>Local landmarks and neighborhood references</li>
                <li>Location-specific photos</li>
                <li>Embedded Google Maps for that address</li>
                <li>Local testimonials and reviews from that location's customers</li>
                <li>Local business hours</li>
                <li>Unique service offerings or specialties at that location</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Google Business Profile for Each Location</h2>

            <p>This is non-negotiable: each physical location needs a separate, verified Google Business Profile (GBP) listing. Not optional. Required.</p>

            <h3>GBP Setup Checklist per Location</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Separate verified listing:</strong> Each location needs Google to verify it independently (postcard mail-in or phone verification)</li>
                <li><strong>Unique photos:</strong> Don't use the same photos for every location. Upload location-specific photos — interior, team, storefront</li>
                <li><strong>Location-specific categories:</strong> Tailor categories to what that location specializes in</li>
                <li><strong>Location-specific posts:</strong> Use GBP's "Post" feature to share local news, local events, community involvement</li>
                <li><strong>Local business hours:</strong> If one location is open different hours, reflect it accurately</li>
                <li><strong>Attribute everything to the right location:</strong> Photos, reviews, posts should be clearly tied to the right address</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Creating Unique Location Pages</h2>

            <p>Duplicate content is the #1 killer of multi-location rankings. Here's how to avoid it:</p>

            <h3>What NOT to Do</h3>
            <p>Don't create a template and just swap the city name:</p>

            <p><em>"We are [City] leaders in [Service]. Serving [City] since [Year]. Call [City] for [Service]."</em></p>

            <p>This screams "low-effort duplicate content" to Google and customers alike.</p>

            <h3>What TO Do</h3>
            <p>Make each page genuinely unique with:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neighborhood-specific references:</strong> "Serving Beacon Hill and Back Bay" not just "Boston"</li>
                <li><strong>Local landmarks:</strong> "Near the waterfront" or "In the financial district"</li>
                <li><strong>Local team bios:</strong> Who works at this location? Feature them</li>
                <li><strong>Local case studies:</strong> A project you completed in that city</li>
                <li><strong>Embedded Google Maps:</strong> Directions from local landmarks</li>
                <li><strong>Local testimonials:</strong> Customer quotes from that location specifically</li>
                <li><strong>Local events:</strong> Sponsorships, community involvement in that specific city</li>
                <li><strong>City-specific content:</strong> Local market conditions, seasonal factors, local competition</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Aim for 300+ words of unique content per location page. 500+ is better. This isn't padding — it's genuinely helpful information about doing business in that specific area.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Citation Management at Scale</h2>

            <p>Citations (mentions of your business name, address, and phone) are critical for local SEO. At scale, they're also complex.</p>

            <h3>NAP Consistency Rules</h3>
            <p>Your Name, Address, and Phone must be identical across every directory:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>No abbreviations inconsistency (St. vs Street)</li>
                <li>Consistent spacing and punctuation</li>
                <li>Same phone format (555-555-5555 vs (555) 555-5555 — pick one)</li>
                <li>Exact address matching across all platforms</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>One typo in one directory can signal to Google that your business information is unreliable.</strong></p>

            <h3>Priority Directories for Multi-Location Business</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Google (GBP) — most important</li>
                <li>Yelp — critical for credibility</li>
                <li>Facebook — essential for locations</li>
                <li>Apple Maps — iOS users</li>
                <li>Bing Places — often overlooked but impacts Bing rankings</li>
                <li>Industry-specific directories (for your business type)</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Review Strategy for Multiple Locations</h2>

            <p>Reviews are ranking signals. Managing them across 5, 10, or 50 locations requires a system:</p>

            <h3>Location-Specific Review Generation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Send review requests with location-specific CTAs ("Review our Boston location")</li>
                <li>Make it easy for customers to review the right location</li>
                <li>Track which location has the most reviews and which needs attention</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Review Response by Location</h3>
            <p>Don't use cookie-cutter responses across all locations:</p>

            <p><em>Bad:</em> "Thanks for the review!" (for every location)</p>

            <p><em>Good:</em> "Thanks! We're so glad you had a great experience at our Boston office. We hope to see you again soon!"</p>

            <p>Location-specific responses show customers and Google that you're actually engaged with each location's community.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Content Strategy Across Locations</h2>

            <p>Your blog and content should reflect your multi-location presence:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location-specific blog posts:</strong> "What to expect at our New York office" or "New Year trends in the Boston market"</li>
                <li><strong>Local event coverage:</strong> Did your team sponsor a local event? Cover it on your blog</li>
                <li><strong>Community involvement:</strong> Feature local team members and their involvement in community</li>
                <li><strong>Location-specific case studies:</strong> A project from that city, with local results and impact</li>
                <li><strong>Competitive analysis:</strong> Who are the other players in each location? What makes you different?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This content reinforces that you're not just a national brand dropping into a city — you're genuinely invested in each location.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Common Multi-Location SEO Mistakes</h2>

            <p>These mistakes tank multi-location rankings. Avoid them:</p>

            <h3>Mistake #1: Cookie-Cutter Location Pages</h3>
            <p>Template pages with just the city swapped out. Google penalizes duplicate content. Your locations cannibalize each other.</p>

            <h3>Mistake #2: Ignoring Individual GBP Listings</h3>
            <p>Having verified GBP listings but never updating them. No location-specific photos. No local posts. Dead listings rank poorly.</p>

            <h3>Mistake #3: Inconsistent Hours/Info</h3>
            <p>Your website says Monday-Friday, Google says Monday-Saturday. Your phone on Yelp is different from your phone on Google. Customers and Google get confused.</p>

            <h3>Mistake #4: Not Localizing Content</h3>
            <p>Everything is written for a national audience, with no local flavor or references. Your pages don't rank locally because Google can't tell you're actually serving that location.</p>

            <h3>Mistake #5: One-Size-Fits-All Review Strategy</h3>
            <p>You ask for reviews generically without specifying location. Reviews aren't attributed to the right location. Some locations have tons of reviews; others have none.</p>

            <h3>Mistake #6: Poor Internal Linking</h3>
            <p>Your location pages don't link to each other. There's no hub page linking to all locations. Google can't efficiently crawl your location pages.</p>

            <p><strong>Fix these six mistakes today and you'll instantly outrank 90% of your multi-location competitors.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Multi-location SEO is complex, but it's also your biggest competitive advantage. If you execute it correctly, you own search results across your entire service area while competitors are stuck fighting over one market.</p>

            <p>Start with your website structure (subdirectories). Verify each location on Google. Create genuinely unique location pages. Keep citations consistent. Manage reviews by location. And don't stop — multi-location SEO requires ongoing optimization as your business grows.</p>

            <p>The businesses that get this right don't just grow — they dominate their markets.</p>
