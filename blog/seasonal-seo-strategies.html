    <div class="container" style="max-width:780px;">
        <div class="reveal">
            <p class="intro-text">Most local businesses focus their content efforts on "always useful" information. How to choose a plumber. Signs you need a new roof. Tax deduction tips. These are valuable, but they're also competitive and evergreen.</p>

            <p>What they miss: seasonal content that captures 10x the search volume at the exact moment customers are searching. "Best dehumidifier for basement summer" beats "how to choose a dehumidifier" — during summer. "Tax preparation for self-employed Q1 2026" beats generic tax content.</p>

            <p>This guide shows you how to plan seasonal content, capture holiday traffic, and dominate searches during peak seasons in your industry.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Why Seasonal Planning Matters</h2>

            <p>Search behavior changes dramatically by season:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Air conditioning repair searches spike. Home improvement projects increase. Outdoor services peak.</li>
                <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Heating repair searches spike. Snow removal. Holiday shopping and decorating.</li>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Lawn care, landscaping, home renovations, wedding planning.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Back-to-school, Halloween, holiday preparation, gutter cleaning.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Additionally, there are specific holidays and events within each season where search volume explodes for a limited time.</p>

            <p>If you're not creating content 2-3 months before these peaks, you're missing the opportunity. By the time peak season hits and you start creating content, it's too late to rank.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">

            <h2>Seasonal Keywords: Plan 2-3 Months Ahead</h2>

            <p>Search volume for seasonal keywords follows a predictable pattern:</p>

            <p>Searches peak 2-3 months BEFORE the actual season/holiday. People plan ahead.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Summer AC repair searches peak in March/April (not July)</li>
                <li>Christmas shopping searches peak in October (not December)</li>
                <li>Wedding venue searches peak 6+ months before the wedding</li>
                <li>Tax prep searches peak December-February (not in April)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This means you need to publish content about summer services in March. Content about winter services in August. Content about holiday events in September.</p>

            <p>If you wait until the season actually arrives, you're months too late.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Industry-Specific Seasonality Examples</h2>

            <h3>HVAC Contractors</h3>
            <p>Winter heating repairs peak Nov-Feb (publish content July-Aug). Summer AC repairs peak May-Aug (publish content Feb-Mar). Spring/fall transition brings furnace tune-ups. Plan 2-3 months ahead.</p>

            <h3>Tax Professionals & Accountants</h3>
            <p>Tax season is Jan-April (start publishing content in Oct-Nov). Q1 planning content (Dec-Jan). Q2-Q4 tax planning/strategy content (publish throughout year). Consider your client base: individuals, small business, self-employed.</p>

            <h3>Wedding Services (Venues, Photographers, Caterers, Planners)</h3>
            <p>Spring/June weddings are most popular. People search 6+ months ahead. Publish wedding content in July-Nov. Fall/winter weddings less common but still searchable. Engagement season (proposals) spikes Nov-Dec, searches follow immediately.</p>

            <h3>Home Improvement & Contracting</h3>
            <p>Spring and summer peak (March-August). Interior projects year-round. Winter is slow for exterior work but opportunities for furnace/heating repairs. Publish spring content in Jan-Feb.</p>

            <h3>Landscaping & Lawn Care</h3>
            <p>Spring is huge (March-May). Summer maintenance (June-Aug). Fall cleanup (Sept-Oct). Winter in northern climates is snow removal (Nov-March). Publish spring content in Jan-Feb.</p>

            <h3>Retail & E-commerce</h3>
            <p>Q4 (Oct-Dec) is 30-40% of annual revenue. Start holiday content in Aug-Sept. Black Friday/Cyber Monday is Nov. Valentine's content (Jan). Back-to-school (July-Aug).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Updating Old Seasonal Content</h2>

            <p>Your seasonal content from last year is a goldmine. Instead of creating from scratch, update and republish:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Update year/dates ("2025 Wedding Venues" becomes "2026 Wedding Venues")</li>
                <li>Update specific numbers (pricing, counts)</li>
                <li>Refresh any outdated information</li>
                <li>Re-optimize for current keywords</li>
                <li>Update internal links to newer content</li>
                <li>Republish with new publication date</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Google treats this as fresh content and gives it a ranking boost. Content that ranked #5 last year can rank #2 this year after a good refresh and republish.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Planning Your Seasonal Content Calendar</h2>

            <p>Here's the process:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Audit Your Industry Seasonality (Dec-Jan)</h3>
            <p>Map out when your customers search, buy, and need your services. When are your peak months? When is it slow?</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Build Your Annual Content Calendar (Dec-Jan)</h3>
            <p>For each month, list:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Seasonal themes</li>
                <li>Holidays/events</li>
                <li>Content you'll create</li>
                <li>Publication dates (publish 2-3 months early)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Research Seasonal Keywords (Ongoing)</h3>
            <p>Use Google Trends, keyword tools, and search volume data to identify rising keywords in your seasonal niches. Create content targeting these.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Create Content Templates</h3>
            <p>For recurring seasonal content (Christmas gift guide, New Year resolution blog, Summer entertaining guide), create a template you can quickly update each year.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Publish 2-3 Months Early</h3>
            <p>Don't wait for the season. Publish summer content in March. Fall/winter content in August. Holiday content in September.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Seasonal Content Tools & Resources</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Trends:</strong> See search volume patterns by season. Identify when your keywords peak.</li>
                <li><strong>SEMrush / Ahrefs:</strong> Seasonal keyword research. See search volume trends over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Holiday Calendar:</strong> Keep a master calendar of major holidays and events in your industry.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Search Console:</strong> Track which seasonal content performs best. Double down on what works.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Seasonal content is one of the highest-ROI <a href="/blog/">content strategy</a> opportunities for local businesses. Most competitors ignore it, which means you can dominate search results during peak seasons with the right planning.</p>

            <p>Build your annual calendar now. Identify your 3-5 biggest seasonal opportunities. Create content for each one 2-3 months before the season hits. Republish and update old seasonal content every year. Over time, your seasonal content will generate 40-50% of your annual organic traffic.</p>
