    <p>You already know your New Hampshire business needs SEO. Maybe you've watched competitors climb to the top of Google while your phone stays quiet. Maybe you've read enough to understand that organic search drives more local customers than any other marketing channel. The question isn't whether you need SEO — it's how to pick the right agency to do it.</p>

    <p>And that's where most business owners get stuck. There are hundreds of SEO companies pitching New Hampshire businesses right now. Some are excellent. Many are mediocre. A few are outright scams. The difference between the right choice and the wrong one can mean the difference between doubling your leads and wasting thousands of dollars over six months with nothing to show for it.</p>

    <p>Here are seven questions you should ask any SEO agency before you sign a contract. These aren't theoretical — they're the exact questions that separate agencies who deliver real results from those who just collect a monthly check.</p>

    <h2>1. Do They Specialize in Local SEO?</h2>

    <p>This is the single most important question, and it's the one most business owners skip. Not all SEO is the same. A company that specializes in e-commerce SEO for national brands uses completely different strategies than one focused on getting a plumber in Manchester to show up in the Google Map Pack.</p>

    <p>Local SEO is its own discipline. It requires deep expertise in <strong>Google Business Profile optimization</strong>, local citation building, review management, geo-targeted content, and Map Pack ranking factors. An agency that does "SEO" generically might be very good at ranking blog posts nationally but have no idea how to get your business into the local 3-pack — which is where the majority of your customers are actually looking.</p>

    <p>When you're evaluating an agency, ask them specifically: <em>What percentage of your clients are local businesses? How do you approach Google Business Profile optimization? What's your strategy for Map Pack rankings?</em> If they can't give you detailed, specific answers about local SEO tactics, they're not the right fit for a New Hampshire business that depends on local customers.</p>

    <p>The agency you choose should understand the difference between ranking for "best CRM software" (national SEO) and ranking for "plumber near me in Nashua NH" (local SEO). These require fundamentally different approaches, and an agency that treats them the same will waste your money.</p>

    <h2>2. Can They Show Real Results from Similar Businesses?</h2>

    <p>Talk is cheap. Every SEO agency on the planet claims they deliver results. What separates the real ones from the pretenders is evidence.</p>

    <p>Ask for <strong>case studies from businesses similar to yours</strong> — ideally local service businesses in competitive markets. You want to see before-and-after data: where was the client ranking before they started? Where are they now? How long did it take? What did traffic and leads look like before versus after?</p>

    <p>A legitimate agency will be able to show you screenshots of ranking improvements, Google Analytics traffic graphs, and real metrics like phone calls generated and form submissions received. They should be able to walk you through the specific work they did to achieve those results — not just wave vaguely at a chart going up. As an example, our <a href="/case-studies.html">case studies</a> show the exact before-and-after data for three NH businesses.</p>

    <p>Be especially wary of agencies that only show national or big-brand case studies. Ranking a Fortune 500 company is a completely different challenge than ranking a local HVAC company in Concord. You need proof that they can deliver results in your specific context: a local business, in New Hampshire, competing against other local businesses for the same customers.</p>

    <h2>3. What's Included in Their Pricing?</h2>

    <p>SEO pricing for New Hampshire small businesses typically ranges from $500 to $2,500 per month for quality work. But what matters more than the dollar amount is what you're actually getting for that money. Two agencies can both charge $1,000 a month — one might deliver comprehensive local SEO services while the other sends you an automated report and calls it a day.</p>

    <p>Before you agree to anything, get a detailed breakdown of exactly what's included. At a minimum, you should expect: <strong>Google Business Profile management</strong>, on-page optimization, technical SEO fixes, content creation (at least 2-4 pieces per month), local citation building, and monthly reporting with real metrics.</p>

    <p>If you want a deeper dive into what SEO should cost and what you should get at each price tier, we wrote a complete breakdown: <a href="/blog/seo-cost-nh-small-business.html">How Much Does SEO Cost for a Small Business in NH?</a> That guide covers every pricing tier from DIY to enterprise, so you can benchmark any quote you receive against realistic market rates.</p>

    <p>The key is specificity. If the agency's answer to "what do I get?" is a vague list of buzzwords — "optimization," "link building," "reporting" — push harder. You want deliverables: how many pages optimized per month, how many blog posts written, how many citations built, how many hours of actual work dedicated to your account.</p>

    <h2>4. Do They Use Ethical (White Hat) Techniques?</h2>

    <p>This question can save you from a disaster. Some SEO agencies still use shady tactics — buying links from spam sites, stuffing keywords into invisible text, creating fake reviews, or using private blog networks — to get quick results. These techniques might produce a short-term ranking boost, but when Google catches on (and they always do), your site can be penalized or even removed from search results entirely.</p>

    <p><strong>If an agency promises you #1 rankings overnight, walk away.</strong> That's not how legitimate SEO works. Real results take 3-6 months of consistent, ethical work — we cover the full timeline in our guide on <a href="/blog/how-long-seo-takes.html">how long SEO takes to show results</a>. Anyone promising instant results is either lying or planning to use risky tactics that will come back to bite you.</p>

    <p>Ask the agency directly: <em>What's your link building strategy? Can you show me examples of sites where you've built links for other clients? Do you follow Google's webmaster guidelines?</em> A white-hat agency will be happy to explain their methods in detail. An agency using black-hat tactics will deflect, get vague, or claim they use "proprietary methods" they can't share.</p>

    <p>The consequences of bad SEO are severe. We've seen NH businesses come to us after being penalized by Google because their previous agency bought hundreds of spammy backlinks. Recovering from a Google penalty can take months and cost far more than doing it right from the start.</p>

    <h2>5. Will They Work with Your Existing Website?</h2>

    <p>Here's a tactic some agencies use to pad their invoices: they tell you your current website is hopeless and you need a complete redesign before SEO can even begin. Sometimes that's true — if your site was built in 2015 on Flash, yes, you need a new one. But more often than not, your existing website can be optimized effectively with targeted improvements rather than a ground-up rebuild.</p>

    <p>A good SEO agency should evaluate your current site first and give you an honest assessment. <strong>Can your site be optimized as-is with on-page fixes, speed improvements, and content additions?</strong> Or does it genuinely have technical problems that make a rebuild necessary? There's a big difference between "your site needs a new contact form and faster hosting" and "we need to charge you $10,000 for a new website before we start."</p>

    <p>Ask the agency: <em>Can you work with my current website? What platform is it built on, and does that affect your ability to optimize it? What specific technical issues need to be addressed?</em> A trustworthy agency will give you a straight answer and explain exactly what needs to change and why — without trying to upsell you on a rebuild you might not need.</p>

    <p>If your website does need significant changes, a good agency should be able to make those improvements as part of the SEO engagement, working within your existing platform rather than forcing you onto theirs. Be skeptical of any agency that insists you must use their proprietary website builder. That creates lock-in and makes it expensive to leave.</p>

    <h2>6. How Do They Report Results?</h2>

    <p>Reporting is where you find out whether your SEO investment is actually working — or whether you're paying for a monthly PDF full of meaningless numbers. The quality of an agency's reporting tells you a lot about the quality of their work.</p>

    <p>Good SEO reporting should show you <strong>metrics that tie directly to your business goals</strong>: how many phone calls came from organic search, how many form submissions, how many direction requests on Google Maps, which keywords you're ranking for and how those rankings changed this month, and how your organic traffic compares to previous months.</p>

    <p>Bad reporting looks like this: a bunch of graphs showing "impressions" and "total keywords tracked" with no context about what it means for your business. If you can't look at a report and answer the question "is this making me money?" then the reporting isn't doing its job.</p>

    <p>Ask the agency: <em>What does your monthly report look like? Can you show me a sample report? Do you track phone calls and leads from organic search? How often do we review results together?</em> The best agencies don't just send a report — they schedule a monthly call or meeting to walk you through the data, explain what's working, what's not, and what the plan is for next month.</p>

    <p>Also ask about the tools they use. Reputable agencies use industry-standard tools like Google Search Console, Google Analytics, and professional rank tracking software. They should be willing to give you access to these tools so you can verify the data yourself.</p>

    <h2>7. Do They Offer a Trial or Guarantee?</h2>

    <p>This is the question that separates confident agencies from ones that hide behind contracts. If an agency truly believes in their ability to deliver results, they should be willing to let you see the quality of their work before you commit to a long-term engagement.</p>

    <p>Ask about trial periods, money-back guarantees, or at minimum, <strong>month-to-month agreements</strong> with no long-term lock-in. An agency that insists on a 12-month contract with no out clause before you've seen a single result is protecting themselves, not you. The best agencies earn your business month after month through results, not through contract enforcement.</p>

    <p>Be especially cautious of agencies that require large upfront payments. A reasonable setup fee for initial auditing and onboarding is normal, but paying thousands of dollars before any work has been done is a red flag.</p>

    <h2>Use This as Your Checklist</h2>

    <p>Before you hire any SEO agency for your New Hampshire business, run them through these seven questions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Do they specialize in local SEO?</strong> — Generic SEO won't move the needle for a local business</li>
        <li><strong>Can they show real results from similar businesses?</strong> — Demand case studies with actual data</li>
        <li><strong>What exactly is included in their pricing?</strong> — Get specific deliverables, not buzzwords</li>
        <li><strong>Do they use ethical techniques?</strong> — Run from anyone promising instant #1 rankings</li>
        <li><strong>Will they work with your existing website?</strong> — Be skeptical of forced redesigns</li>
        <li><strong>How do they report results?</strong> — Insist on metrics tied to real business outcomes</li>
        <li><strong>Do they offer a trial or month-to-month terms?</strong> — Confidence shows in flexibility</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If an agency can answer all seven of these questions convincingly, with specifics and evidence, they're probably worth talking to. If they dodge, deflect, or give you generic marketing speak, keep looking.</p>
