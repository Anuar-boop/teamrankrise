    <div class="container" style="max-width:780px;">
        <div class="reveal">
            <p class="intro-text">A personal injury case in NH is worth $50,000 to $500,000+ in fees. A DUI defense case runs $5,000 to $15,000. A divorce case averages $10,000 to $25,000. Every one of those cases starts the same way: someone types a search into Google. The law firm that ranks first gets the call. The one on page 2 gets nothing.</p>

            <p>Legal SEO in New Hampshire is brutally competitive — and extremely valuable. This guide covers every strategy specific to getting NH law firms found on Google, from <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-tips.html">Google Business Profile optimization</a> to practice area page structure to the <a href="/blog/local-seo-guide-nh.html">local SEO fundamentals</a> that drive client inquiries.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Why SEO Matters More for Lawyers Than Almost Any Other Industry</h2>

            <p>Legal services have the highest cost-per-click of any industry in Google Ads — $50 to $200+ per click for competitive practice areas. That means:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Ads for lawyers</strong> in NH can cost $3,000-$15,000/month for meaningful visibility</li>
                <li><strong>One organic ranking</strong> for "personal injury lawyer manchester nh" can generate $500,000+ in annual case value</li>
                <li><strong>96% of people seeking legal advice</strong> use a search engine as their starting point</li>
                <li><strong>74% of consumers</strong> visit a law firm's website before making contact</li>
                <li><strong>Average client lifetime value</strong> for a general practice firm is $3,000-$8,000</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The math is simple: <a href="/blog/small-business-seo-budget.html">investing $1,500/month in SEO</a> that generates 3-5 new client inquiries per month is dramatically more cost-effective than paying $100+ per click for ads. And unlike ads, SEO builds a compounding asset — your rankings grow over time instead of stopping the moment you stop paying.</p>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Top Keywords for local Law Firms</h2>

            <p>Keyword strategy for lawyers differs from other industries because practice areas have vastly different values and competition levels. Here are the highest-priority keyword clusters:</p>

            <div style="overflow-x:auto;">
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Keyword</th>
                        <th>Est. Monthly Searches</th>
                        <th>Competition</th>
                        <th>Case Value</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>personal injury lawyer [city] nh</td><td>260-590</td><td>Very High</td><td>$50K-$500K+</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>car accident lawyer nh</td><td>480</td><td>Very High</td><td>$20K-$200K</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>divorce lawyer [city] nh</td><td>320-480</td><td>High</td><td>$10K-$25K</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>dui lawyer nh</td><td>590</td><td>High</td><td>$5K-$15K</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>criminal defense lawyer nh</td><td>390</td><td>High</td><td>$5K-$50K</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>estate planning lawyer nh</td><td>260</td><td>Medium</td><td>$3K-$8K</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>workers comp lawyer nh</td><td>210</td><td>Medium</td><td>$15K-$100K</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>real estate attorney [city] nh</td><td>170-320</td><td>Medium</td><td>$2K-$5K</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>family law attorney nh</td><td>320</td><td>Medium</td><td>$5K-$15K</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>business lawyer nh</td><td>140</td><td>Low-Medium</td><td>$5K-$50K</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>immigration lawyer nh</td><td>170</td><td>Low-Medium</td><td>$3K-$10K</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>slip and fall lawyer nh</td><td>90</td><td>Medium</td><td>$25K-$200K</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            </div>

            <p>Notice: personal injury and car accident keywords have the highest competition because of the massive case values. But lower-competition practice areas like estate planning, real estate closings, and business law can be easier to rank for and still extremely profitable. <a href="/blog/keyword-research-local-seo.html">Smart keyword research</a> targets the gaps your competitors are ignoring.</p>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Google Business Profile for Law Firms</h2>

            <p>The <a href="/blog/google-maps-ranking-nh.html">Google Map Pack</a> appears above organic results for nearly all "lawyer near me" and "[practice area] lawyer [city]" searches. For law firms, GBP optimization is non-negotiable.</p>

            <h3>Category Selection</h3>

            <p>Your primary <a href="/blog/google-business-profile-categories-guide.html">GBP category</a> should match your highest-value practice area:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal injury:</strong> "Personal Injury Attorney" (not "Lawyer" or "Law Firm")</li>
                <li><strong>Criminal defense:</strong> "Criminal Justice Attorney"</li>
                <li><strong>Family law:</strong> "Family Law Attorney" or "Divorce Lawyer"</li>
                <li><strong>Estate planning:</strong> "Estate Planning Attorney"</li>
                <li><strong>General practice:</strong> "Law Firm" (use specific secondary categories)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Secondary categories:</strong> Add every practice area you handle. Google allows up to 9 secondary categories — use all of them. A personal injury firm might add: Law Firm, Accident Attorney, Workers' Compensation Attorney, Wrongful Death Attorney.</p>

            <h3>Profile Optimization Specifics</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Business description:</strong> Lead with your primary practice area and location. "Manchester, NH personal injury law firm with 20+ years of experience. We've recovered over $50 million for accident victims across New Hampshire."</li>
                <li><strong>Services:</strong> List every practice area with descriptions. Be specific — "Car Accident Claims," "Truck Accident Lawsuits," "Motorcycle Accident Injuries," not just "Personal Injury."</li>
                <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Office interior (shows professionalism), team headshots (builds trust), community involvement, awards/certifications. No stock photos — Google detects and devalues them.</li>
                <li><strong>Posts:</strong> Weekly GBP posts about case results (anonymized), legal tips, NH law changes, community events. Each post keeps your profile active and signals relevance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reviews for Law Firms</h3>

            <p>Legal reviews are sensitive — clients don't always want to publicly discuss their legal matters. Strategies that work:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ask at case resolution</strong> — when the client is satisfied with the outcome</li>
                <li><strong>Make it easy</strong> — send a direct Google review link via email with a simple template they can customize</li>
                <li><strong>Suggest general language</strong> — "You don't need to mention your case. Something like 'Professional, responsive, and got great results' is perfect."</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on service quality</strong> — reviews about communication, responsiveness, and professionalism are just as valuable as outcome-focused reviews</li>
                <li><strong>Respond to all reviews</strong> — professionally, without revealing case details (ethics rules apply)</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Website Structure for Law Firms</h2>

            <p>A law firm website needs to accomplish three things: rank for practice area keywords, establish credibility, and convert visitors into consultations.</p>

            <h3>Practice Area Pages (Critical)</h3>

            <p>The single biggest mistake law firms make: listing all practice areas on one page. You need individual, comprehensive pages for each:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Injury</strong> (main hub) → Car Accidents, Truck Accidents, Slip and Fall, Medical Malpractice, Wrongful Death</li>
                <li><strong>Criminal Defense</strong> (main hub) → DUI/DWI, Drug Charges, Assault, Theft, Domestic Violence</li>
                <li><strong>Family Law</strong> (main hub) → Divorce, Child Custody, Child Support, Alimony, Prenuptial Agreements</li>
                <li><strong>Estate Planning</strong> (main hub) → Wills, Trusts, Probate, Power of Attorney, Estate Administration</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each sub-page targets its specific keyword ("car accident lawyer manchester nh"), includes NH-specific legal information, and has a clear consultation CTA. See our guide on <a href="/blog/service-pages-that-rank-convert.html">creating service pages that rank and convert</a>.</p>

            <h3>Location Pages</h3>

            <p>If you serve clients across NH, create city-specific pages. A <a href="/seo-manchester-nh.html">Manchester</a>-based firm should have pages for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>"Personal Injury Lawyer Manchester NH" — reference the Hillsborough County Superior Court, local accident statistics, Manchester-specific case examples</li>
                <li>"Divorce Attorney <a href="/seo-nashua-nh.html">Nashua</a> NH" — mention the Nashua Family Division court, Nashua-specific family law considerations</li>
                <li>"DUI Lawyer <a href="/seo-concord-nh.html">Concord</a> NH" — reference Concord District Court, NH DUI laws and penalties</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each page needs genuinely unique content about practicing in that specific court system and community — not the same page with the city name swapped.</p>

            <h3>Attorney Bio Pages</h3>

            <p>Individual attorney pages are ranking opportunities. "John Smith attorney Manchester NH" gets searched more than you'd think. Each bio should include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Practice areas and bar admissions</li>
                <li>Education and notable case results</li>
                <li>Professional photo (not a stock image)</li>
                <li>Community involvement in NH</li>
                <li><a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">Attorney schema markup</a> (Person + Attorney types)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conversion Elements</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Free consultation CTA</strong> — prominent on every page. "Free Case Review" or "Free Consultation" with phone + form</li>
                <li><strong>Live chat</strong> — potential clients often have quick questions before committing to call</li>
                <li><strong>Case results page</strong> — anonymized outcomes with dollar amounts establish credibility</li>
                <li><strong>Trust signals</strong> — Super Lawyers, Avvo rating, NH Bar Association, "No fee unless we win" badges</li>
                <li><strong>Click-to-call</strong> — especially on mobile, one tap to connect</li>
                <li><strong>Intake form</strong> — name, email, phone, brief case description. Keep it short — long forms kill conversion rates</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Content Strategy for Law Firms</h2>

            <p>Legal content serves two purposes: ranking for informational keywords (top of funnel) and building authority that makes Google trust your practice area pages (bottom of funnel).</p>

            <h3>Blog Topics That Drive Client Inquiries</h3>

            <p><strong>Question-based content</strong> (targets "People Also Ask" and featured snippets):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"How much is my car accident claim worth in NH?"</li>
                <li>"What are the penalties for a first DUI in New Hampshire?"</li>
                <li>"How long does a divorce take in NH?"</li>
                <li>"Do I need a lawyer for a real estate closing in NH?"</li>
                <li>"What is the statute of limitations for personal injury in NH?"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>NH-specific legal guides:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"NH Comparative Fault Law: How It Affects Your Injury Claim"</li>
                <li>"Understanding NH's At-Fault Car Insurance System"</li>
                <li>"NH Divorce Laws: Property Division, Custody, and Support Explained"</li>
                <li>"NH DUI Laws Updated for 2026: What You Need to Know"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Seasonal and timely content:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Winter: "NH Ice and Snow Accident Claims — Who's Liable?"</li>
                <li>Summer: "Motorcycle Accident Laws in NH — What Riders Need to Know"</li>
                <li>Tax season: "Estate Planning Deadlines NH Residents Shouldn't Miss"</li>
                <li>Back to school: "NH Child Custody and School District Changes"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Publish 2-4 pieces per month. Each article should link to your relevant practice area page and include a consultation CTA.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Link Building for Law Firms</h2>

            <p>Legal directories and local organizations provide the best backlinks for local law firms. Focus on <a href="/blog/get-local-backlinks-nh.html">local link building</a>:</p>

            <h3>Legal Directories (Priority Order)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Avvo</strong> — claimed and optimized profile (free, high authority)</li>
                <li><strong>FindLaw</strong> — lawyer directory listing</li>
                <li><strong>Justia</strong> — free lawyer profiles</li>
                <li><strong>Lawyers.com</strong> — Martindale-Hubbell directory</li>
                <li><strong>Super Lawyers</strong> — if eligible, this is a powerful trust signal</li>
                <li><strong>NH Bar Association</strong> — member directory link</li>
                <li><strong>Yelp</strong> — claimed business profile</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Local NH Links</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Local chamber of commerce memberships</li>
                <li>NH Business Review or NH Magazine features</li>
                <li>Sponsor local events (charity runs, community events)</li>
                <li>Guest columns in local newspapers</li>
                <li>NH nonprofit board memberships</li>
                <li>Local business networking groups</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Ensure your <a href="/blog/nap-consistency-local-seo.html">NAP information is consistent</a> across all directories. One wrong phone number or address variation can hurt your Map Pack rankings.</p>

        <div class="reveal">
            <h2>Common SEO Mistakes Law Firms Make</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>One practice area page for everything</strong> — "Personal Injury, Criminal Defense, Family Law, Estate Planning" on a single page. Google can't rank you for any of them effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>No city-specific pages</strong> — targeting "lawyer NH" instead of "personal injury lawyer manchester nh." Specificity wins in local search.</li>
                <li><strong>Relying entirely on Avvo/FindLaw</strong> — directory profiles are important but shouldn't be your only online presence. You need your own website ranking independently.</li>
                <li><strong>Stock photos everywhere</strong> — users and Google both recognize stock images. Real office and team photos build dramatically more trust.</li>
                <li><strong>No content strategy</strong> — a website with 5 pages and no blog will struggle to rank against firms publishing 2-4 articles per month.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring reviews</strong> — letting a 3.5-star rating sit with 8 reviews while competitors have 50+ reviews at 4.8 stars. Volume and recency matter.</li>
                <li><strong>Keyword stuffing</strong> — "Our Manchester NH personal injury lawyers in Manchester New Hampshire provide personal injury legal services in Manchester." Google penalizes this. Write naturally.</li>
                <li><strong>No schema markup</strong> — <a href="/blog/schema-markup-local-business.html">Attorney and LegalService schema</a> helps Google understand your practice areas and service locations. Most law firms don't use it — competitive advantage for those who do.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow website</strong> — overloaded with large images, unnecessary plugins, and tracking scripts. <a href="/blog/website-speed-optimization.html">Speed matters</a> for both rankings and conversions.</li>

            <p><strong>Real example:</strong> A <a href="/seo-manchester-nh.html">Manchester</a> family law firm ranking #1 for "divorce lawyer manchester nh" gets approximately 40-60 clicks per month. With a 10% conversion rate to consultations, that's 4-6 new potential clients per month. At an average case value of $10,000, that's $40,000-$60,000 in potential monthly revenue from a single keyword — generated by a $2,000/month SEO investment.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>

            <p>Legal SEO in NH is competitive but not saturated. The firms investing in SEO now are building advantages that will compound for years. The firms waiting are falling further behind with every passing month.</p>

            <p><strong>Priority order for law firms new to SEO:</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Claim and optimize your GBP</strong> — this alone can generate consultations within 30 days</li>
                <li><strong>Build practice area pages</strong> — one comprehensive page per practice area with NH-specific content</li>
                <li><strong>Start a review system</strong> — ask every satisfied client. Make it easy. Respond to every review</li>
                <li><strong>Claim legal directories</strong> — Avvo, FindLaw, Justia, NH Bar, Yelp</li>
                <li><strong>Publish content monthly</strong> — NH legal guides that answer real questions your clients ask</li>
                <li><strong>Build <a href="/services.html#local-seo">local SEO</a> authority</strong> — citations, community links, consistent NAP</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The investment is small relative to the value of a single case. One new personal injury client can pay for an entire year of SEO. One divorce case covers 3-6 months. The ROI isn't theoretical — it's math.</p>
