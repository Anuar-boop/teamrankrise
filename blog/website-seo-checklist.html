    <p>Most small business owners know that SEO matters. They've heard that "being on Google" is important. But when it comes to actually optimizing their website, they're often left staring at a blank page wondering: where do I even start?</p>

    <p>SEO can feel overwhelming. There are hundreds of ranking factors. Algorithms change constantly. Everyone's selling you something.</p>

    <p>Here's the truth: most of the big SEO wins come from getting the fundamentals right. You don't need to be a technical expert or spend thousands on agencies. You just need a practical checklist of the essentials that actually move the needle.</p>

    <p>After optimizing hundreds of small business websites across New Hampshire, I've identified the 15 factors that consistently make the biggest difference. Work through this checklist, fix what's broken, and you'll outrank competitors who are doing nothing.</p>

    <h2>1. Check Your Page Titles (Unique, Keyword-Rich, Under 60 Characters)</h2>

    <p>Your page title is the first thing Google shows in search results, and it's one of the most important ranking factors. Yet most small business websites have generic, keyword-poor titles or — worse — duplicate titles across multiple pages.</p>

    <p>What makes a good page title:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unique for every page</strong> — Each page should have a different title that reflects its specific content</li>
        <li><strong>Includes your primary keyword</strong> — Put your target keyword near the beginning of the title</li>
        <li><strong>Under 60 characters</strong> — Longer titles get cut off in search results</li>
        <li><strong>Front-loads the value</strong> — "How to Fix Frozen Pipes Fast (2026)" is better than "Plumbing Tips — Smith Plumbing NH"</li>
        <li><strong>Includes your brand</strong> — If you have room after your keyword, add your business name</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Audit your site right now. Go to your homepage, your main service pages, and your blog posts. Are the titles optimized? Are they duplicated? If you're not doing this, you're leaving ranking opportunities on the table.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <h4>Quick Audit</h4>
        <p>Go to Google Search Console → Pages → manually search your domain. Look at the titles Google is actually displaying. If they're cut off, truncated, or unclear, you need to rewrite them.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Write Compelling Meta Descriptions (150-160 Characters, Include CTA)</h2>

    <p>Meta descriptions don't directly impact rankings, but they dramatically affect click-through rates. A compelling meta description can be the difference between someone clicking your result or clicking your competitor's.</p>

    <p>Google will sometimes rewrite your meta description in search results, but if you don't provide one, they'll pull random snippets from your page content that might not make sense.</p>

    <p>What a good meta description does:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Summarizes the page in 150-160 characters</li>
        <li>Includes your primary keyword naturally (without keyword stuffing)</li>
        <li>Has a clear benefit or CTA: "Learn the 7 secrets to..." or "Discover how to..."</li>
        <li>Matches the search intent</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Example: Instead of "We provide plumbing services in Manchester, Nashua, and surrounding areas," try "Emergency plumber in Manchester NH — same-day service, upfront pricing, 24/7 available. Call for free estimate."</p>

    <p>That second version is more specific, has a CTA, and tells potential customers exactly what they get.</p>

    <h2>3. Use Header Tags Properly (H1 Once, H2/H3 for Structure)</h2>

    <p>Header tags tell Google the structure of your content. They help both the algorithm and users understand what your page is about. Yet many websites misuse them or use them haphazardly.</p>

    <p>The best practice:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>One H1 per page</strong> — This should match (or closely match) your page title and include your primary keyword</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple H2s and H3s</strong> — Break your content into logical sections with descriptive subheadings</li>
        <li><strong>Don't skip levels</strong> — Go H1 → H2 → H3, not H1 → H3 → H2</li>
        <li><strong>Make them descriptive</strong> — "Our Services" is worse than "Plumbing Services We Offer in Manchester NH"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your header structure should look like an outline. If you removed all the paragraph text and just read the headers, would the page make sense? If not, reorganize.</p>

    <h2>4. Optimize Images (Alt Text, Compression, WebP Format)</h2>

    <p>Images are often overlooked in SEO, but they matter. Google's image algorithm is sophisticated and can help drive traffic. Plus, optimized images improve user experience and page speed.</p>

    <p>Three things to check:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alt text</strong> — Every image should have descriptive alt text that includes relevant keywords. "Image" or "photo" is worthless. "Manchester plumber fixing burst pipe" is much better.</li>
        <li><strong>Compression</strong> — Large images slow down your site. Use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh to compress without losing quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Modern formats</strong> — WebP format is significantly smaller than JPG or PNG. Use WebP where possible, with PNG/JPG fallbacks for older browsers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Go through your top-ranking pages and check if images have alt text. If you're seeing missing alt attributes, that's a quick win you can fix today.</p>

    <h2>5. Ensure Mobile-Friendliness (Responsive Design, Tap Targets)</h2>

    <p>Over 60% of searches now come from mobile devices. Google has been using mobile-first indexing since 2018. If your site isn't mobile-friendly, Google will penalize you.</p>

    <p>Check these mobile factors:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Responsive design</strong> — Your site should look good on phones, tablets, and desktops without horizontal scrolling</li>
        <li><strong>Tap targets</strong> — Buttons and links should be large enough to tap with a thumb (minimum 48x48 pixels)</li>
        <li><strong>Font size</strong> — Text should be readable on mobile without zooming</li>
        <li><strong>Navigation</strong> — Mobile menus should be clear and easy to use</li>
        <li><strong>Viewport settings</strong> — Your site should have the proper viewport meta tag: &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Use Google's Mobile-Friendly Test tool (just search "mobile friendly test") to see if your site passes.</p>

    <h2>6. Check Page Speed (Core Web Vitals, Image Compression)</h2>

    <p>Page speed is a confirmed ranking factor. Slow sites rank worse than fast sites. Beyond rankings, slow sites have higher bounce rates and lower conversion rates — which directly impacts your business.</p>

    <p>Three Core Web Vitals you should track:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</strong> — How fast the main content loads (aim for under 2.5 seconds)</li>
        <li><strong>First Input Delay (FID)</strong> — How responsive your page is to user interaction</li>
        <li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</strong> — How stable your page layout is as it loads</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Quick wins for speed:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Compress and optimize all images</li>
        <li>Enable browser caching</li>
        <li>Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</li>
        <li>Minify CSS and JavaScript</li>
        <li>Remove unused code and plugins</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Check your site in Google PageSpeed Insights. It will give you a score and specific recommendations. Many of these are fixable even without coding knowledge.</p>

    <h2>7. Add Schema Markup (LocalBusiness, Breadcrumbs)</h2>

    <p>Schema markup is structured data that tells Google exactly what your content means. It helps Google understand your business, your products, your content — and it can earn you rich snippets in search results.</p>

    <p>Must-have schema for small businesses:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>LocalBusiness</strong> — For your homepage, include your business name, address, phone, business hours, and service areas</li>
        <li><strong>BreadcrumbList</strong> — Helps Google understand your site structure</li>
        <li><strong>Article</strong> — If you publish blog posts, mark them with Article schema</li>
        <li><strong>FAQPage</strong> — If you have a FAQ section, mark it up. Google sometimes displays FAQs in search results</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You don't need coding skills to add schema. Tools like Yoast SEO or Rank Math will handle it for you. Just make sure it's actually being implemented — don't assume.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <h4>Verify Your Schema</h4>
        <p>Use Google's Rich Results Test. Paste your URL and see if Google recognizes your schema. If it doesn't, that markup isn't working.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>8. Create a Google Business Profile (Or Optimize Your Existing One)</h2>

    <p>If you're a local business and you don't have a Google Business Profile (or it's incomplete), you're invisible to a huge portion of potential customers. Your GBP is often the first thing people see when they search for you.</p>

    <p>Action items:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Claim or verify your GBP at <a href="https://www.google.com/business/">google.com/business</a></li>
        <li>Choose the right primary category (be specific, not broad)</li>
        <li>Write a keyword-rich business description</li>
        <li>Add your full address, phone number, and business hours</li>
        <li>Upload high-quality photos (at least 5-10 to start)</li>
        <li>Enable messaging and booking if applicable</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your GBP and your website SEO are interconnected. A strong GBP improves your local rankings and drives traffic to your website. A website with good SEO makes your GBP more trustworthy in Google's eyes.</p>

    <h2>9. Build Local Citations (NAP Consistency)</h2>

    <p>A citation is any online mention of your business name, address, and phone number (NAP). Google uses citations to verify your business exists, especially for local searches.</p>

    <p>The key principle: your NAP must be identical everywhere it appears.</p>

    <p>Places to build citations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Google Business Profile</li>
        <li>Bing Places for Business</li>
        <li>Apple Maps</li>
        <li>Industry directories (e.g., Angie's List for contractors, ZocDoc for healthcare)</li>
        <li>Local chambers of commerce</li>
        <li>Yelp</li>
        <li>Better Business Bureau</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Critical rule: make sure your NAP is EXACTLY the same everywhere. If your website says "Smith Plumbing, Inc." but your Google Business Profile says "Smith Plumbing Inc" (no comma), Google sees these as different businesses. Even small inconsistencies hurt you.</p>

    <h2>10. Get Google Reviews (And Respond to Them)</h2>

    <p>Google reviews are one of the most important local ranking factors and they dramatically influence customer decisions. Businesses with more reviews rank higher. Period.</p>

    <p>How to build a review generation system:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>After completing a service, send a follow-up text or email within 24 hours with a direct link to your Google review page</li>
        <li>Make it easy: include a QR code that goes directly to your review page</li>
        <li>Keep the message personal: "Hi [Name], thanks for choosing us! If you have a moment, a Google review would mean the world to us: [link]"</li>
        <li>Follow up with happy customers every single time — make it a process</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Then, respond to every review. Thank positive reviewers by name. Address negative reviews professionally and constructively. This shows future customers that you care about feedback.</p>

    <p>Responding to reviews also signals to Google that your business is active and engaged — which improves your visibility.</p>

    <h2>11. Internal Linking (Link Pages Together Logically)</h2>

    <p>Internal links pass authority from page to page within your site. They tell Google which pages are important and how your site is organized. Most small business websites miss massive opportunities here.</p>

    <p>Best practices:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Link your homepage to your top service pages</strong> — Your homepage has the most authority; pass that to your highest-priority pages</li>
        <li><strong>Create hub pages</strong> — Write comprehensive guides that link to multiple related pages</li>
        <li><strong>Use descriptive anchor text</strong> — Instead of "click here," use "Learn about our plumbing services" or "read our complete local SEO guide"</li>
        <li><strong>Don't over-link</strong> — 3-5 internal links per page is usually ideal. More becomes spammy.</li>
        <li><strong>Link contextually</strong> — Links should make sense within the paragraph, not random footer links</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you publish new blog posts, link to your service pages. When you update your services pages, link to relevant blog posts. This creates a web of connections that Google crawls and uses to understand your site.</p>

    <h2>12. Fix Broken Links (404 Errors Kill SEO)</h2>

    <p>Broken links (404 errors) hurt your SEO for two reasons: they waste Google's crawl budget crawling dead pages, and they send a signal that your site isn't well-maintained.</p>

    <p>How to find and fix them:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Use Google Search Console to see pages that are returning 404 errors</li>
        <li>Check for broken internal links using tools like Screaming Frog or SEMrush</li>
        <li>Check for broken external links (links to other websites that no longer exist)</li>
        <li>Fix them by either: updating the link to the correct URL, or creating a 301 redirect from the old URL to the new one</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you've changed URL structures or deleted pages, set up redirects. Don't just leave them broken.</p>

    <h2>13. Secure Your Site with HTTPS</h2>

    <p>HTTPS (the green lock icon) is not just for security — it's a ranking factor. Google gives a slight boost to HTTPS sites over HTTP sites.</p>

    <p>If your site doesn't show a green lock, fix it immediately:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Contact your hosting provider to install an SSL certificate (often included for free)</li>
        <li>Update all your internal links to use HTTPS instead of HTTP</li>
        <li>Set up 301 redirects from HTTP pages to HTTPS pages</li>
        <li>Update your Google Search Console property to the HTTPS version of your site</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is a technical lift that usually requires your hosting provider's help, but it's critical. Modern browsers actively warn users about non-HTTPS sites. Don't let that be you.</p>

    <h2>14. Submit Your Sitemap to Google Search Console</h2>

    <p>A sitemap is a file that lists all the important pages on your website. Submitting it to Google Search Console tells Google about your pages and helps them get discovered and crawled faster.</p>

    <p>Steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Generate a sitemap (most CMS platforms do this automatically, or use tools like XML-Sitemaps.com)</li>
        <li>Upload it to your site's root directory (usually at /sitemap.xml)</li>
        <li>Go to Google Search Console → Sitemaps → submit your sitemap URL</li>
        <li>Check back periodically to see if Google is crawling your pages successfully</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Submitting your sitemap doesn't guarantee ranking, but it helps Google discover your pages faster. This is especially important if your site is large or your internal linking structure isn't perfect.</p>

    <h2>15. Track Rankings with Free Tools</h2>

    <p>You can't improve what you don't measure. Track your keyword rankings to see if your SEO efforts are working.</p>

    <p>Free tools for tracking rankings:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Search Console</strong> — Shows which keywords bring clicks, impressions, and average ranking position. This is the most important tool.</li>
        <li><strong>Ubersuggest</strong> — Free tier includes keyword rank tracking</li>
        <li><strong>SE Ranking</strong> — Limited free tier for rank tracking</li>
        <li><strong>Moz Keyword Explorer</strong> — Free keyword research and competitive analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Start with Google Search Console. It's free and it's the source of truth for how Google sees your site.</p>

    <p>Check your rankings monthly. Track not just your position, but also clicks and impressions. Sometimes your position stays the same but clicks increase (or decrease) — that tells you something important about your click-through rate.</p>

    <p>Set goals. If you're currently ranking #8 for your main keyword, aim for #5 in 90 days. Make incremental progress, not sudden leaps.</p>

    <h2>Common SEO Mistakes Small Businesses Make</h2>

    <p>After auditing hundreds of small business websites, these are the mistakes I see most frequently:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>No clear keyword strategy</strong> — They're just winging it. You need to know which keywords you're targeting on each page.</li>
        <li><strong>Duplicate content</strong> — Multiple pages targeting the same keyword compete with each other instead of supporting each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Thin content</strong> — 300-word pages won't rank for competitive keywords. Most pages should be 1,000+ words.</li>
        <li><strong>No updates</strong> — They publish once and never touch it again. Update your top-ranking pages at least annually.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring user experience</strong> — Confusing navigation, slow loading, poor mobile experience. Google penalizes bad UX.</li>
        <li><strong>Stuffing keywords</strong> — Writing unnaturally just to include keywords. Write for humans first, Google second.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your 30-Day Action Plan</h2>

    <p>Don't try to do all 15 at once. Here's a realistic 30-day plan:</p>

    <p><strong>Week 1:</strong> Audit your page titles, meta descriptions, and page speed. Fix the low-hanging fruit.</p>

    <p><strong>Week 2:</strong> Fix broken links. Check your header tag structure. Add alt text to images.</p>

    <p><strong>Week 3:</strong> Set up or optimize your Google Business Profile. Build citations on 3-5 new directories.</p>

    <p><strong>Week 4:</strong> Implement schema markup. Submit your sitemap to Google Search Console. Set up Google review requests.</p>

    <p>After 30 days, most of these 15 factors will be in place. You'll see improvements in traffic within 2-3 months as Google recrawls and re-indexes your pages.</p>
