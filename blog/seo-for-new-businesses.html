            <p class="lead">You just launched your business. Congratulations. Now comes the hard part: getting customers. You&rsquo;ve got no reviews, no website history, no Google credibility. But here&rsquo;s the good news: you can start ranking on day one with the right strategy. This guide covers the first 30 days and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Days 1-7: Immediate Actions (Priority 1)</h2>

            <h3>Claim Your Google Business Profile Immediately</h3>

            <p>This is not optional. Go to <strong>business.google.com</strong> and claim your business today. Ideally, Google hasn&rsquo;t created a listing yet (since you&rsquo;re brand new), so you&rsquo;ll create one from scratch.</p>

            <p>See our <a href="/blog/create-google-business-profile.html">complete GBP setup guide</a> for step-by-step instructions. But here&rsquo;s the minimum:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Business name (exactly, no keywords added)</li>
                <li>Local address (real, not virtual)</li>
                <li>Local phone number (not toll-free)</li>
                <li>Primary business category (specific, not generic)</li>
                <li>Website URL (link to your homepage)</li>
                <li>Verify via postcard, phone, or email</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Verification takes 1-14 days. Start this immediately.</p>

            <h3>Register Your Domain</h3>

            <p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, register a domain that includes your business name and ideally your location. Examples:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>smithplumbing.com (best)</li>
                <li>smith-plumbing-manchester.com (local keyword, okay)</li>
                <li>plumbingmanchesternh.com (keyword-stuffed, avoid)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Use a registrar like Namecheap or GoDaddy. Avoid sketchy resellers.</p>

            <h3>Set Up Google Analytics and Search Console</h3>

            <p>These free tools are essential for tracking SEO performance.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Search Console:</strong> Shows your rankings, clicks, impressions, and search queries. Go to search.google.com/search-console</li>
                <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> Tracks website visitors, traffic sources, and user behavior. Go to analytics.google.com</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Add your website to both and verify ownership. These will be your SEO dashboards.</p>

            <h2>Days 8-14: Website Foundation (Priority 2)</h2>

            <h3>Build or Redesign for SEO</h3>

            <p>Your website is your SEO engine. It needs to be:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mobile-first responsive.</strong> 90% of local customers search on mobile. See our <a href="/blog/mobile-seo-local-business.html">mobile SEO guide</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Fast.</strong> Under 3 seconds load time. See <a href="/blog/page-speed-seo-ranking.html">page speed optimization</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Structured data markup.</strong> Add Schema.org markup for local business, your address, phone, hours, and reviews.</li>
                <li><strong>SSL certificate (HTTPS).</strong> Non-HTTPS sites don't rank. It's table-stakes.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear navigation.</strong> Users and Google should understand your site structure in 3 clicks.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Use a CMS like WordPress with SEO plugins (Yoast, Rank Math) or hire a developer who understands SEO fundamentals.</p>

            <h3>Create Your Core Pages</h3>

            <p>At minimum, you need:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Homepage:</strong> Clearly state what you do, where you serve, and why customers should choose you. Include local keywords naturally.</li>
                <li><strong>About page:</strong> Tell your story. When did you start? Why? What makes you different? This builds trust and E-A-T.</li>
                <li><strong>Services page:</strong> Each major service gets a dedicated page (or section) with descriptions and why you&rsquo;re the best choice.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact page:</strong> Prominent contact form, address, phone, hours, map. Make it easy to reach you.</li>
                <li><strong>Blog:</strong> Start a simple blog for content marketing (more on this later).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Week 2: Initial Keyword Research (Priority 1)</h2>

            <h3>Find Your Keywords</h3>

            <p>You need to know what people search for in your industry and location. Tools:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Search Console:</strong> Shows what keywords you&rsquo;re already being found for (starting week 2-3).</li>
                <li><strong>Google Autocomplete:</strong> Type your service + location into Google. The dropdown shows real searches.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Trends:</strong> See search volume trends for keywords over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Free tools:</strong> Ubersuggest, AnswerThePublic, KeywordTool.io</li>
                <li><strong>Paid tools:</strong> Ahrefs, SEMrush, Moz (Ahrefs and SEMrush have 7-day trials)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Target Keywords by Type</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Brand keywords:</strong> Your business name (you&rsquo;ll rank easily for these)</li>
                <li><strong>Local keywords:</strong> &ldquo;[Service] [Your City]&rdquo; (e.g., &ldquo;plumber Manchester NH&rdquo;)</li>
                <li><strong>Category keywords:</strong> &ldquo;[Service] near me&rdquo; and &ldquo;best [service] [area]&rdquo;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Focus first on category + local keywords. These are the most valuable for your business.</p>

            <h2>Days 15-21: Building Your Citation Foundation (Priority 1)</h2>

            <h3>What Are Citations?</h3>

            <p>Citations are online mentions of your business name, address, and phone (NAP) on directories and websites. They tell Google your business is real and where you operate.</p>

            <h3>Must-Claim Directories</h3>

            <p>These are non-negotiable for new businesses:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Business Profile:</strong> Already claimed (if you followed step 1)</li>
                <li><strong>Yelp:</strong> Claim your Yelp page at biz.yelp.com</li>
                <li><strong>Apple Maps:</strong> Go to mapkit.js.apple.com/moc</li>
                <li><strong>Facebook Business Page:</strong> Create a business page, not a personal profile</li>
                <li><strong>Your local Chamber of Commerce:</strong> List your business on their directory</li>
                <li><strong>Industry-specific directories:</strong> HVAC contractors go to HVAC directories, dentists to dental directories, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Citation Best Practices</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>NAP consistency:</strong> Your name, address, and phone must match EXACTLY across all directories. Smith Plumbing vs. Smith's Plumbing breaks rankings.</li>
                <li><strong>Use local address:</strong> Never use PO boxes, virtual offices, or co-working spaces (unless you have a dedicated private office).</li>
                <li><strong>Include your website URL:</strong> Every directory listing should link back to your site.</li>
                <li><strong>Use category tags:</strong> Select the most specific business category available.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>See our <a href="/blog/local-citations-guide-nh.html">complete citations guide</a> for 50+ directories where you should list.</p>

            <h2>Week 3: Getting Your First Reviews (Priority 1)</h2>

            <h3>Why Reviews Matter for New Businesses</h3>

            <p>New businesses have zero reviews. This is a huge problem because:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Customers don't trust businesses with no reviews</li>
                <li>Google prioritizes businesses with more reviews</li>
                <li>Reviews are a major ranking factor for local search</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So your goal: get 10-15 reviews in your first 30 days. Here&rsquo;s how.</p>

            <h3>Getting Your First Reviews</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ask friends and family first.</strong> Not ideal (Google prefers diverse reviewers), but you need some reviews to build momentum.</li>
                <li><strong>Offer a small incentive (ethically).</strong> &ldquo;Leave us a review on Google and we'll give you 10% off your next visit.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t pay for reviews; that violates Google&rsquo;s terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Add a link to your email signature.</strong> Include a link to your Google review page. Make it easy.</li>
                <li><strong>Add a review request to your homepage.</strong> A simple &ldquo;Love our service? Leave us a review!&rdquo; with links to Google, Yelp, and Facebook.</li>
                <li><strong>After every customer interaction, ask in person or via text.&rdquo;We'd love a review on Google. Here's the link: [link]&rdquo;</li>
                <li><strong>Create a QR code</strong> linking to your Google review page. Display it on signage or receipts.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>See our complete guide: <a href="/blog/get-more-google-reviews.html">How to Get More Google Reviews</a>.</p>

            <h2>Week 4: Content Strategy and First Posts (Priority 2)</h2>

            <h3>Why New Businesses Need Content</h3>

            <p>Established competitors have years of content and links. You start with zero. Content is your competitive advantage because you can:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Target keywords competitors haven't</li>
                <li>Answer customer questions they ignore</li>
                <li>Build topical authority faster</li>
                <li>Drive social and referral traffic</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>First Month Content Strategy</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Create 4 foundational blog posts.</strong>

                    <ul>
                        <li>&ldquo;What is [Your Service]? Complete Beginner's Guide&rdquo;</li>
                        <li>&ldquo;[Service] Cost: What to Expect&rdquo;</li>
                        <li>&ldquo;How to Choose a [Service] Provider&rdquo;</li>
                        <li>&ldquo;[Service] Common Mistakes&rdquo;</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Each post: 1,500-2,000 words.</strong> Depth ranks better than short posts.</li>
                <li><strong>Target your local keywords.</strong> Use keywords in title, headings, and first 100 words.</li>
                <li><strong>Link to your service pages.</strong> Every blog post should link to your main website pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Add schema markup.</strong> Use LocalBusiness, Article, and BreadcrumbList schema.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote on social.</strong> Share every post on Facebook, Instagram, and Google Business Profile.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Publishing Schedule</h3>

            <p>Start with 1-2 posts per week. Quality over frequency. A well-researched post beats 5 mediocre posts.</p>

            <h2>First 90 Days: Realistic Timeline</h2>

            <p>What should you expect?</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Days 1-30:</strong> Claim GBP, set up website, build citations. Few organic visitors. Maybe 5-20 per week.</li>
                <li><strong>Days 31-60:</strong> GBP verified. First 10-20 reviews live. Website ranking for brand keywords. Google sends you 50-150 organic visits per month.</li>
                <li><strong>Days 61-90:</strong> You're appearing in local search for some category keywords. Blog posts starting to rank. 150-400 organic visits per month.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This assumes consistent effort. Skipping weeks kills momentum. See <a href="/blog/how-long-seo-takes.html">how long SEO takes</a> for full timelines.</p>

            <h2>First 12 Months: Year 1 Roadmap</h2>

            <p>By month 12, a well-optimized new business should:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Rank in the Google local pack for primary keywords</li>
                <li>Have 50-100+ reviews (depending on industry)</li>
                <li>Get 300-1000+ organic website visits per month</li>
                <li>Appear on the first page of Google for local searches</li>
                <li>Have published 30-50 blog posts on target topics</li>
                <li>Dominate branded search (your business name)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Month 1-3:</strong> Foundation (GBP, website, citations, first reviews). Limited visibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Month 4-6:</strong> Momentum (20-30 reviews, 30-50 blog posts). Start appearing in local search for some keywords.</p>

            <p><strong>Month 7-9:</strong> Authority (40-60+ reviews, 50+ blog posts, backlinks from citations and social shares). Ranking for more keywords. Organic traffic ramping up.</p>

            <p><strong>Month 10-12:</strong> Dominance (80-100+ reviews, 60+ blog posts, established as local authority). Traffic 3-5x higher than month 1.</p>

            <h2>Common New Business SEO Mistakes</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Skipping GBP.</strong> Without a Google Business Profile, you won&rsquo;t appear in local search. This is the #1 mistake.</li>
                <li><strong>Inconsistent NAP information.</strong> Smith Plumbing on Google, Smith's Plumbing on Yelp, Smith Plumbing Co. on your website. Google gets confused. Choose ONE name and use it everywhere.</li>
                <li><strong>Building a website nobody can find.</strong> A beautiful website means nothing if Google can't crawl it or users can't navigate it. Focus on SEO fundamentals first, design second.</li>
                <li><strong>No content strategy.</strong> Expecting to rank without creating content. Competitors have years of rankings. You catch up with consistent content.</li>
                <li><strong>Not asking for reviews.</strong> Reviews don't appear magically. You have to ask. Every customer should be asked.</li>
                <li><strong>Expecting fast results.</strong> SEO takes time. If someone promises top rankings in 30 days, they're lying or using sketchy tactics.</li>
                <li><strong>Hiring cheap SEO &ldquo;experts.&rdquo;</strong> A $99/month SEO company isn't an expert. They're using automation and outdated tactics. Invest in quality, or do it yourself following this guide.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring mobile optimization.</strong> 90% of your customers will find you on mobile. A desktop-only site loses 9 out of 10 leads.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Should You Hire an SEO Agency?</h2>

            <p>New businesses often ask: &ldquo;Should I DIY SEO or hire an agency?&rdquo;</p>

            <p><strong>Do it yourself if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have time to learn and implement (10+ hours/week)</li>
                <li>You're comfortable with basic technical concepts</li>
                <li>Your industry has low competition</li>
                <li>You have a limited budget</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Hire an agency if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your industry is highly competitive (plumbing, dentistry, law)</li>
                <li>You need results in 90 days (not months)</li>
                <li>You want expert guidance on strategy</li>
                <li>You have budget ($1,500-5,000/month for serious results)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Either way, understand the fundamentals. An informed business owner makes better decisions.</p>
