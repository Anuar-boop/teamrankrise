            <h2>Why Durham Businesses Need Local SEO</h2>
            <p>Durham is the heart of North Carolina's Research Triangle — a 22,000-acre hub that attracts world-class researchers, biotechnology companies, and healthcare innovators.

            <p>Every month, thousands of Duke students, visiting researchers, healthcare patients, and tech professionals search for restaurants, housing, professional services, medical care, and tech support.

            <p>The businesses that invest in <a href="/services.html#local-seo">local SEO</a> capture these high-value searches and grow. The ones that don't stay invisible — no matter how prestigious their credentials or specialized their expertise.</p>
